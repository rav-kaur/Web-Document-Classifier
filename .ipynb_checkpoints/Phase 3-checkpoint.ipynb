Intelligence\\nWhat it is and why it matters\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nArtificial intelligence (AI) makes it possible for machines to learn from experience, adjust to new inputs and perform human-like tasks. Most AI examples that you hear about today \\xe2\\x80\\x93 from chess-playing computers to self-driving cars \\xe2\\x80\\x93 rely heavily on deep learning and natural language processing. Using these technologies, computers can be trained to accomplish specific tasks by processing large amounts of data and recognizing patterns in the data.\\n\\n\\nHistory\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0Today\\'s World\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0How It\\'s Used\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0How It Works\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence History\\n\\nThe term artificial intelligence was coined in 1956, but AI has become more popular today thanks to increased data volumes, advanced algorithms, and improvements in computing power and storage.\\nEarly AI research in the 1950s explored topics like problem solving and symbolic methods. In the 1960s, the US Department of Defense took interest in this type of work and began training computers to mimic basic human reasoning. For example, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) completed street mapping projects in the 1970s. And DARPA produced intelligent personal assistants in 2003, long before Siri, Alexa or Cortana were household names.\\nThis early work paved the way for the automation and formal reasoning that we see in computers today, including decision support systems and smart search systems that can be designed to complement and augment human abilities.\\nWhile Hollywood movies and science fiction novels depict AI as human-like robots that take over the world, the current evolution of AI technologies isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t that scary \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or quite that smart. Instead, AI has evolved to provide many specific benefits in every industry. Keep reading for modern examples of artificial intelligence in health care, retail and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1950s\\xe2\\x80\\x931970s\\nNeural Networks\\n\\nEarly work with neural networks stirs excitement for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthinking machines.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1980s\\xe2\\x80\\x932010s\\nMachine Learning\\nMachine learning becomes popular.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPresent Day\\nDeep Learning\\nDeep learning breakthroughs drive AI boom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAI has been an integral part of SAS software for years. Today we help customers in every industry capitalize on advancements in AI, and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll continue embedding AI technologies like machine learning and deep learning in solutions across the SAS portfolio.\\n\\n\\nJim Goodnight\\nCEO\\nSAS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLearn more about SAS for AI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence and Machine Learning\\n\\nQuick, watch this video to understand the relationship between AI and machine learning. You\\'ll see how these two technologies work, with examples and a few funny asides.\\nPlus, this is a great video to share with friends and family to explain artificial intelligence in a way that anyone will understand.\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy is artificial intelligence important?\\n\\n\\nAI automates repetitive learning and discovery through data.\\xc2\\xa0But AI is different from hardware-driven, robotic automation. Instead of automating manual tasks, AI performs frequent, high-volume, computerized tasks reliably and without fatigue. For this type of automation, human inquiry is still essential to set up the system and ask the right questions.\\nAI adds intelligence to existing products. In most cases, AI will not be sold as an individual application. Rather, products you already use will be improved with AI capabilities, much like Siri was added as a feature to a new generation of Apple products. Automation, conversational platforms, bots and smart machines can be combined with large amounts of data to improve many technologies at home and in the workplace, from security intelligence to investment analysis.AI adapts through progressive learning algorithms to let the data do the programming. AI finds structure and regularities in data so that the algorithm acquires a skill: The algorithm becomes a classifier or a predictor. So, just as the algorithm can teach itself how to play chess, it can teach itself what product to recommend next online. And the models adapt when given new data. Back propagation is an AI technique that allows the model to adjust, through training and added data, when the first answer is not quite right.\\n\\n\\n\\nAI analyzes more and deeper data using neural networks that have many hidden layers. Building a fraud detection system with five hidden layers was almost impossible a few years ago. All that has changed with incredible computer power and big data. You need lots of data to train deep learning models because they learn directly from the data. The more data you can feed them, the more accurate they become.AI achieves incredible accuracy through deep neural networks \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which was previously impossible. For example, your interactions with Alexa, Google Search and Google Photos are all based on deep learning \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and they keep getting more accurate the more we use them. In the medical field, AI techniques from deep learning, image classification and object recognition can now be used to find cancer on MRIs with the same accuracy as highly trained radiologists.AI gets the most out of data. When algorithms are self-learning, the data itself can become intellectual property. The answers are in the data; you just have to apply AI to get them out. Since the role of the data is now more important than ever before, it can create a competitive advantage. If you have the best data in a competitive industry, even if everyone is applying similar techniques, the best data will win.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWildTrack and SAS: Saving endangered species one footprint at a time.\\n\\n\\n\\nFlagship species like the cheetah are disappearing.

Other uses of AI include:\\n\\n\\nHealth Care\\n\\nAI applications can provide personalized medicine and X-ray readings. Personal health care assistants can act as life coaches, reminding you to take your pills, exercise or eat healthier.\\n\\n\\nRetail\\n\\nAI provides virtual shopping capabilities that offer personalized recommendations and discuss purchase options with the consumer. Stock management and site layout technologies will also be improved with AI.\\n\\n\\nManufacturing\\n\\nAI can analyze factory IoT data as it streams from connected equipment to forecast expected load and demand using recurrent networks, a specific type of deep learning network used with sequence data. \\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\n\\nBanking\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence enhances the speed, precision and effectiveness of human efforts. In financial institutions, AI techniques can be used to identify which transactions are likely to be fraudulent, adopt fast and accurate credit scoring, as well as automate manually intense data management tasks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWorking together with AI\\nArtificial intelligence is not here to replace us. It augments our abilities and makes us better at what we do. Because AI algorithms learn differently than humans, they look at things differently. They can see relationships and patterns that escape us. This human, AI partnership offers many opportunities. It can:\\nBring analytics to industries and domains where it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s currently underutilized.Improve the performance of existing analytic technologies, like computer vision and time series analysis.\\nBreak down economic barriers, including language and translation barriers.Augment existing abilities and make us better at what we do.\\nGive us better vision, better understanding, better memory and much more. \\xc2\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat are the challenges of using artificial intelligence?\\nArtificial intelligence is going to change every industry, but we have to understand its limits.\\nThe principle limitation of AI is that it learns from the data. There is no other way in which knowledge can be incorporated. That means any inaccuracies in the data will be reflected in the results. And any additional layers of prediction or analysis have to be added separately.\\nToday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s AI systems are trained to do a clearly defined task. The system that plays poker cannot play solitaire or chess. The system that detects fraud cannot drive a car or give you legal advice. In fact, an AI system that detects health care fraud cannot accurately detect tax fraud or warranty claims fraud.\\nIn other words, these systems are very, very specialized. They are focused on a single task and are far from behaving like humans.\\nLikewise, self-learning systems are not autonomous systems. The imagined AI technologies that you see in movies and TV are still science fiction. But computers that can probe complex data to learn and perfect specific tasks are becoming quite common.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSAS\\xc2\\xae Visual Data Mining and Machine Learning\\nAI is simplified when you can prepare data for analysis, develop models with modern machine-learning algorithms and integrate text analytics all in one product. Plus, you can code projects that combine SAS with other languages, including Python, R, Java or Lua.\\n\\n\\nTry it for free\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow Artificial Intelligence Works\\n\\n\\nAI works by combining large amounts of data with fast, iterative processing and intelligent algorithms, allowing the software to learn automatically from patterns or features in the data. AI is a broad field of study that includes\\xc2\\xa0many theories, methods and technologies, as well as the following major subfields:\\n\\nMachine learning\\xc2\\xa0automates analytical model building. It uses methods from neural networks, statistics, operations research and physics to find hidden insights in data without explicitly being programmed for where to look or what to conclude.A neural network is a type of machine learning that is made up of interconnected units (like neurons) that processes information by responding to external inputs, relaying information between each unit. The process requires multiple passes at the data to find connections and derive meaning from undefined data.Deep learning uses huge neural networks with many layers of processing units, taking advantage of advances in computing power and improved training techniques to learn complex patterns in large amounts of data. Common applications include image and speech recognition.Cognitive computing is a subfield of AI that strives for a natural, human-like interaction with machines. Using AI and cognitive computing, the ultimate goal is for a machine to simulate human processes through the ability to interpret images and speech \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and then speak coherently in response.\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0Computer vision relies on pattern recognition and deep learning to recognize what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in a picture or video. When machines can process, analyze and understand images, they can capture images or videos in real time and interpret their surroundings.Natural language processing (NLP) is the ability of computers to analyze, understand and generate human language, including speech. The next stage of NLP is natural language interaction, which allows humans to communicate with computers using normal, everyday language to perform tasks.\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditionally, several technologies enable and support AI:\\nGraphical processing units are key to AI because they provide the heavy compute power that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s required for iterative processing. Training neural networks requires big data plus compute power.The Internet of Things generates massive amounts of data from connected devices, most of it unanalyzed. Automating models with AI will allow us to use more of it.Advanced algorithms are being developed and combined in new ways to analyze more data faster and at multiple levels. This intelligent processing is key to identifying and predicting rare events, understanding complex systems and optimizing unique scenarios.APIs, or application programming interfaces, are portable packages of code that make it possible to add AI functionality to existing products and software packages. They can add image recognition capabilities to home security systems and Q&A capabilities that describe data, create captions and headlines, or call out interesting patterns and insights in data.\\nIn summary, the goal of AI is to provide software that can reason on input and explain on output. AI will provide human-like interactions with software and offer decision support for specific tasks, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a replacement for humans \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be anytime soon.\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRead More About This Topic\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnalytics leads to lifesaving cancer therapiesA long-shot treatment offers hope to 10-year-old Harrison after he learns the DNA profile of his cancer is resistant to chemo.

Connected machines and objects in factories offer the potential for a \\'fourth industrial revolution\\', and experts predict more than half of new businesses will run on the IoT by 2020.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nHere\\'s everything you need to know about the increasingly connected world. What is the Internet of Things?In the broadest sense, the term IoT encompasses everything connected to the internet, but it is increasingly being used to define objects that \"talk\" to each other. \"Simply, the Internet of Things is made up of devices \\xe2\\x80\\x93 from simple sensors to smartphones and wearables \\xe2\\x80\\x93 connected together,\" Matthew Evans, the IoT programme head at techUK, says. \\nRead next\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is climate change?

The definition, causes and effects\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy\\nWIRED\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nBy combining these connected devices with automated systems, it is possible to \"gather information, analyse it and create an action\" to help someone with a particular task, or learn from a process. In reality, this ranges from smart mirrors to beacons in shops and beyond. \"It\\'s about networks, it\\'s about devices, and it\\'s about data,\" Caroline Gorski, the head of IoT at Digital Catapult explains. IoT allows devices on closed private internet connections to communicate with others and \"the Internet of Things brings those networks together. It gives the opportunity for devices to communicate not only within close silos but across different networking types and creates a much more connected world.\" \\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nWhy do connected devices need to share data?An argument has been raised that only because something can be connected to the internet doesn\\'t mean it should be, but each device collects data for a specific purpose that may be useful to a buyer and impact the wider economy. Within industrial applications, sensors on product lines can increase efficiency and cut down on waste. One study estimates 35 per cent of US manufacturers are using data from smart sensors within their set-ups already. US firm Concrete Sensors has created a device that can be inserted into concrete to provide data on the material\\'s condition, for instance. Subscribe to WIRED \"IoT offers us opportunity to be more efficient in how we do things, saving us time, money and often emissions in the process,\" Evans says. It allows companies, governments and public authorities to re-think how they deliver services and produce goods. \\nRead next\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the Paris climate agreement and who has signed it?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the Paris climate agreement and who has signed it?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy\\nAlexandra Simon-Lewis\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\"The quality and scope of the data across the Internet of Things generates an opportunity for much more contextualised and responsive interactions with devices to create a potential for change,\" continued Gorski. It \"doesn\\'t stop at a screen\". \\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe latest Internet of Things news\\n\\n\\nNone\\nNone\\n\\n\\nNone\\nNone\\n\\n\\nWhere does the IoT go next?Even those who have purchased one of the myriad smart home products \\xe2\\x80\\x93 from lightbulbs, switches, to motion sensors \\xe2\\x80\\x93 will attest to the fact IoT is in its infancy. Products don\\'t always easily connect to each other and there are significant security issues that need to be addressed. A report from Samsung says the need to secure every connected device by 2020 is \"critical\". The firm\\'s Open Economy document says \"there is a very clear danger that technology is running ahead of the game\". The firm said more than 7.3 billion devices will need to be made secure by their manufacturers before 2020. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are looking at a future in which companies will indulge in digital Darwinism, using IoT, AI and machine learning to rapidly evolve in a way we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never seen before,\" Brian Solis, from Altimeter Group, who helped on the research said. \\nRead next\\n\\n\\n\\nHypersonic missiles are coming to change warfare forever\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHypersonic missiles are coming to change warfare forever\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy\\nEleanor Peake\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nIoT botnets, created using a network of out-of-date devices took large websites and services offline in 2016. A Chinese firm later recalled 4.3 million unsecured connected cameras. The ease of bringing down the internet using IoT devices was revealed when instead of malicious purposes, the botnet was revealed to have been created to game Minecraft. But aren\\'t there privacy implications?Everything that\\'s connected to the internet can be hacked, IoT products are no exception to this unwritten rule. Insecure IoT systems led to toy manufacturer VTech losing videos and pictures of children using its connected devices. There\\'s also the issue of surveillance. If every product becomes connected then there\\'s the potential for unbridled observation of users. If a connected fridge tracks food usage and consumption, takeaways could be targeted at hungry people who have no food. If a smartwatch can detect when you\\'re having sex, what is to stop people with that data using it against the watches\\' wearer. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn the future, intelligence services might use the [internet of things] for identification, surveillance, monitoring, location tracking, and targeting for recruitment, or to gain access to networks or user credentials,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d James Clapper, the US direction or national intelligence said in 2016. Wikileaks later claimed the CIA has been developing security exploits for a connected Samsung TV. We need reliable standardsAt the centre of creating a vast, reliable IoT network lies one significant issue: compatible standards. Connected objects need to be able to speak to each other to transfer data and share what they are recording. If they all run on different standards, they struggle to communicate and share. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Standards Association lists a huge number of standards being developed and worked on for different applications. \\nRead next\\n\\n\\n\\nMercury poisoning and fire gilding: the science of S-Town\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMercury poisoning and fire gilding: the science of S-Town\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy\\nAbigail Beall\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\"Additional needs are emerging for standardisation,\" the Internet Society says. If standardisation happens it will let more devices and applications be connected. To try and tackle this issue on an enterprise scale, Microsoft has introduced its own system for IoT devices. Called IoT Central, TechCrunch, reports the system gives businesses a managed central platform for setting up IoT devices. Microsoft claims the system will simply the creation of IoT networks. Gorski described IoT, even among those with the most experience of the concept, as a \"relatively immature market\" but said 2016 may have been a turning point. The Hypercat standard is now supported by ARM, Intel, Amey, Bae Systems and Accenture and the firms are currently agreeing on a format for \"exposing collections\" of URLs, for example. \\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\"In the short term, we know [IoT] will impact on anything where there is a high cost of not intervening,\" Evans said. \"And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be for simpler day-to-day issues \\xe2\\x80\\x93 like finding a car parking space in busy areas, linking up your home entertainment system and using your fridge webcam to check if you need more milk on the way home.\"Ultimately what makes it exciting is that we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t yet know the exact use cases and just that it has the potential to have a major impact on our lives.\"This article was originally published in January 2017.

you have been following banking, investing, or cryptocurrency over the last ten years, you may be familiar with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cblockchain,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the record-keeping technology behind the Bitcoin network. And there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good chance that it only makes so much sense. In trying to learn more about blockchain, you\\'ve probably encountered a definition like this: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cblockchain is a distributed, decentralized, public ledger.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe good news is that blockchain is actually easier to understand than that definition sounds.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n   What is Blockchain?  \\n\\nIf this technology is so complex, why call it \\xe2\\x80\\x9cblockchain?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d At its most basic level, blockchain is literally just a chain of blocks, but not in the traditional sense of those words. When we say the words \\xe2\\x80\\x9cblock\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cchain\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in this context, we are actually talking about digital information (the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cblock\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) stored in a public database (the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cchain\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBlocks\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on the blockchain are made up of digital pieces of information. Specifically, they have three parts:\\n\\n\\n\\nBlocks store information about transactions like the date, time, and dollar amount of your most recent purchase from Amazon. (NOTE: This Amazon example is for illustrative purchases; Amazon retail does not work on a blockchain principle as of this writing)Blocks store information about who is participating in transactions. A block for your splurge purchase from Amazon would record your name along with Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN). Instead of using your actual name, your purchase is recorded without any identifying information using a unique \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdigital signature,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d sort of like a username.Blocks store information that distinguishes them from other blocks. Much like you and I have names to distinguish us from one another, each block stores a unique code called a \\xe2\\x80\\x9chash\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that allows us to tell it apart from every other block. Hashes are cryptographic codes created by special algorithms. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s say you made your splurge purchase on Amazon, but while it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in transit, you decide you just can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t resist and need a second one. Even though the details of your new transaction would look nearly identical to your earlier purchase, we can still tell the blocks apart because of their unique codes.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile the block in the example above is being used to store a single purchase from Amazon, the reality is a little different. A single block on the Bitcoin blockchain can actually store up to 1 MB of data. Depending on the size of the transactions, that means a single block can house a few thousand transactions under one roof.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1:08\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat Is the Blockchain?\\n\\n\\n   How Blockchain Works  \\n\\nWhen a block stores new data it is added to the blockchain. Blockchain, as its name suggests, consists of multiple blocks strung together. In order for a block to be added to the blockchain, however, four things must happen:\\n\\n\\n\\nA transaction must occur. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s continue with the example of your impulsive Amazon purchase. After hastily clicking through multiple checkout prompt, you go against your better judgment and make a purchase. As we discussed above, in many cases a block will group together potentially thousands of transactions, so your Amazon purchase will be packaged in the block along with other users\\' transaction information as well.That transaction must be verified. After making that purchase, your transaction must be verified. With other public records of information, like the Securities Exchange Commission, Wikipedia, or your local library, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s someone in charge of vetting new data entries. With blockchain, however, that job is left up to a network of computers. When you make your purchase from Amazon, that network of computers rushes to check that your transaction happened in the way you said it did. That is, they confirm the details of the purchase, including the transaction\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time, dollar amount, and participants. (More on how this happens in a second.)That transaction must be stored in a block. After your transaction has been verified as accurate, it gets the green light. The transaction\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dollar amount, your digital signature, and Amazon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s digital signature are all stored in a block. There, the transaction will likely join hundreds, or thousands, of others like it.That block must be given a hash. Not unlike an angel earning its wings, once all of a block\\xe2\\x80\\x99s transactions have been verified, it must be given a unique, identifying code called a hash. The block is also given the hash of the most recent block added to the blockchain. Once hashed, the block can be added to the blockchain.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen that new block is added to the blockchain, it becomes publicly available for anyone to view\\xe2\\x80\\x94even you. If you take a look at Bitcoin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s blockchain, you will see that you have access to transaction data, along with information about when (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTime\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), where (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHeight\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), and by who (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRelayed By\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) the block was added to the blockchain.\\n\\n\\n   Is Blockchain Private?  \\n\\nAnyone can view the contents of the blockchain, but users can also opt to connect their computers to the blockchain network as nodes. In doing so, their computer receives a copy of the blockchain that is updated automatically whenever a new block is added, sort of like a Facebook News Feed that gives a live update whenever a new status is posted.\\n\\n\\n\\nEach computer in the blockchain network has its own copy of the blockchain, which means that there are thousands, or in the case of Bitcoin, millions of copies of the same blockchain. Although each copy of the blockchain is identical, spreading that information across a network of computers makes the information more difficult to manipulate. With blockchain, there isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a single, definitive account of events that can be manipulated. Instead, a hacker would need to manipulate every copy of the blockchain on the network. This is what is meant by blockchain being a \"distributed\" ledger.\\n\\n\\n\\nLooking over the Bitcoin blockchain, however, you will notice that you do not have access to identifying information about the users making transactions. Although transactions on the blockchain are not completely anonymous, personal information about users is limited to their digital signature or username.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis raises an important question: if you cannot know who is adding blocks to the blockchain, how can you trust blockchain or the network of computers upholding it?\\n\\n\\n   Is Blockchain Secure?  \\n\\nBlockchain technology accounts for the issues of security and trust in several ways. First, new blocks are always stored linearly and chronologically. That is, they are always added to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cend\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the blockchain. If you take a look at Bitcoin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s blockchain, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll see that each block has a position on the chain, called a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cheight.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d As of January 2020, the block\\xe2\\x80\\x99s height had topped 615,400.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter a block has been added to the end of the blockchain, it is very difficult to go back and alter the contents of the block. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because each block contains its own hash, along with the hash of the block before it. Hash codes are created by a math function that turns digital information into a string of numbers and letters. If that information is edited in any way, the hash code changes as well.\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important to security. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s say a hacker attempts to edit your transaction from Amazon so that you actually have to pay for your purchase twice. As soon as they edit the dollar amount of your transaction, the block\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hash will change. The next block in the chain will still contain the old hash, and the hacker would need to update that block in order to cover their tracks. However, doing so would change that block\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hash. And the next, and so on.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn order to change a single block, then, a hacker would need to change every single block after it on the blockchain. Recalculating all those hashes would take an enormous and improbable amount of computing power. In other words, once a block is added to the blockchain it becomes very difficult to edit and impossible to delete.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo address the issue of trust, blockchain networks have implemented tests for computers that want to join and add blocks to the chain. The tests, called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconsensus models,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d require users to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprove\\xe2\\x80\\x9d themselves before they can participate in a blockchain network. One of the most common examples employed by Bitcoin is called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cproof of work.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the proof of work system, computers must \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprove\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that they have done \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwork\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by solving a complex computational math problem. If a computer solves one of these problems, they become eligible to add a block to the blockchain. But the process of adding blocks to the blockchain, what the cryptocurrency world calls \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmining,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is not easy. In fact, the odds of solving one of these problems on the Bitcoin network were about one in 15.5 trillion in January 2020.\\xef\\xbb\\xbf\\xef\\xbb\\xbf To solve complex math problems at those odds, computers must run programs that cost them significant amounts of power and energy (read: money).\\n\\n\\n\\nProof of work does not make attacks by hackers impossible, but it does make them somewhat useless. If a hacker wanted to coordinate an attack on the blockchain, they would need to control more than 50% of all computing power on the blockchain so as to be able to overwhelm all other participants in the network. Given the tremendous size of the Bitcoin blockchain, a so-called 51% attack is almost certainly not worth the effort and more than likely impossible. (More about this below.)\\n\\n\\n   Blockchain vs. Bitcoin  \\n\\nThe goal of blockchain is to allow digital information to be recorded and distributed, but not edited. That concept can be difficult to wrap our heads around without seeing the technology in action, so let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s take a look at how the earliest application of blockchain technology actually works.\\n\\n\\n\\nBlockchain technology was first outlined in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta, two researchers who wanted to implement a system where document timestamps could not be tampered with. But it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t until almost two decades later, with the launch of Bitcoin in January 2009, that blockchain had its first real-world application.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Bitcoin protocol is built on the blockchain. In a research paper introducing the digital currency, Bitcoin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto referred to it as \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca new electronic cash system that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how it works.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou have all these people, all over the world, who have bitcoin. There are likely many millions of people around the world who own at least a portion of a bitcoin. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s say one of those millions of people wants to spend their bitcoin on groceries. This is where the blockchain comes in.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen it comes to printed money, the use of printed currency is regulated and verified by a central authority, usually a bank or government\\xe2\\x80\\x94but Bitcoin is not controlled by anyone. Instead, transactions made in bitcoin are verified by a network of computers. This is what is meant by the Bitcoin network and blockchain being \"decentralized.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen one person pays another for goods using bitcoin, computers on the Bitcoin network race to verify the transaction. In order to do so, users run a program on their computers and try to solve a complex mathematical problem, called a \\xe2\\x80\\x9chash.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d When a computer solves the problem by \\xe2\\x80\\x9chashing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a block, its algorithmic work will have also verified the block\\xe2\\x80\\x99s transactions. As we described above, the completed transaction is publicly recorded and stored as a block on the blockchain, at which point it becomes unalterable. In the case of Bitcoin, and most other blockchains, computers that successfully verify blocks are rewarded for their labor with cryptocurrency. This is commonly referred to as \"mining.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAlthough transactions are publicly recorded on the blockchain, user data is not\\xe2\\x80\\x94or, at least not in full. In order to conduct transactions on the Bitcoin network, participants must run a program called a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwallet.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Each wallet consists of two unique and distinct cryptographic keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is the location where transactions are deposited to and withdrawn from. This is also the key that appears on the blockchain ledger as the user\\xe2\\x80\\x99s digital signature.\\n\\n\\n\\nEven if a user receives a payment in bitcoins to their public key, they will not be able to withdraw them with the private counterpart. A user\\xe2\\x80\\x99s public key is a shortened version of their private key, created through a complicated mathematical algorithm. However, due to the complexity of this equation, it is almost impossible to reverse the process and generate a private key from a public key. For this reason, blockchain technology is considered confidential.\\n\\n\\n   Public and Private Key Basics  \\n\\nHere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the ELI5\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9cExplain it Like I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m 5\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94version. You can think of a public key as a school locker and the private key as the locker combination. Teachers, students, and even your crush can insert letters and notes through the opening in your locker. However, the only person that can retrieve the contents of the mailbox is the one that has the unique key. It should be noted, however, that while school locker combinations are kept in the principal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office, there is no central database that keeps track of a blockchain network\\xe2\\x80\\x99s private keys. If a user misplaces their private key, they will lose access to their bitcoin wallet, as was the case with this man who made national headlines in December of 2017.\\n\\n\\n  A Single Public Chain  \\n\\nIn the Bitcoin network, the blockchain is not only shared and maintained by a public network of users\\xe2\\x80\\x94but it is also agreed upon. When users join the network, their connected computer receives a copy of the blockchain that is updated whenever a new block of transactions is added. But what if, through human error or the efforts of a hacker, one user\\xe2\\x80\\x99s copy of the blockchain manipulated to be different from every other copy of the blockchain?\\n\\n\\n\\nThe blockchain protocol discourages the existence of multiple blockchains through a process called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconsensus.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d In the presence of multiple, differing copies of the blockchain, the consensus protocol will adopt the longest chain available. More users on a blockchain mean that blocks can be added to the end of the chain quicker. By that logic, the blockchain of record will always be the one that most users trust. The consensus protocol is one of blockchain technology\\xe2\\x80\\x99s greatest strengths but also allows for one of its greatest weaknesses.\\n\\n\\n  Theoretically, Hacker-Proof  \\n\\nTheoretically, it is possible for a hacker to take advantage of the majority rule in what is referred to as a 51% attack. Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how it would happen. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s say that there are five million computers on the Bitcoin network, a gross understatement for sure but an easy enough number to divide. In order to achieve a majority on the network, a hacker would need to control at least 2.5 million and one of those computers. In doing so, an attacker or group of attackers could interfere with the process of recording new transactions. They could send a transaction\\xe2\\x80\\x94and then reverse it, making it appear as though they still had the coin they just spent. This vulnerability, known as double-spending, is the digital equivalent of a perfect counterfeit and would enable users to spend their bitcoins twice.\\n\\n\\n\\nSuch an attack is extremely difficult to execute for a blockchain of Bitcoin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s scale, as it would require an attacker to gain control of millions of computers. When Bitcoin was first founded in 2009 and its users numbered in the dozens, it would have been easier for an attacker to control a majority of computational power in the network. This defining characteristic of blockchain has been flagged as one weakness for fledgling cryptocurrencies.\\n\\n\\n\\nUser fear of 51% attacks can actually limit monopolies from forming on the blockchain. In \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDigital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d New York Times journalist Nathaniel Popper writes of how a group of users, called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBitfury,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d pooled thousands of high-powered computers together to gain a competitive edge on the blockchain. Their goal was to mine as many blocks as possible and earn bitcoin, which at the time were valued at approximately $700 each.\\n\\n\\n  Harnessing Bitfury  \\n\\nBy March 2014, however, Bitfury was positioned to exceed 50% of the blockchain network\\xe2\\x80\\x99s total computational power. Instead of continuing to increase its hold over the network, the group elected to self-regulate itself and vowed never to go above 40%. Bitfury knew that if they chose to continue increasing their control over the network, bitcoin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s value would fall as users sold off their coins in preparation for the possibility of a 51% attack. In other words, if users lose their faith in the blockchain network, the information on that network risks becoming completely worthless. Blockchain users, then, can only increase their computational power to a point before they begin to lose money.\\n\\n\\n   Blockchain\\'s Practical Application  \\n\\nBlocks on the blockchain store data about monetary transactions\\xe2\\x80\\x94we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got that out of the way. But it turns out that blockchain is actually a pretty reliable way of storing data about other types of transactions, as well. In fact, blockchain technology can be used to store data about property exchanges, stops in a supply chain, and even votes for a candidate.\\n\\n\\n\\nProfessional services network Deloitte recently surveyed 1,000 companies across seven countries about integrating blockchain into their business operations. Their survey found that 34% already had a blockchain system in production today, while another 41% expected to deploy a blockchain application within the next 12 months. In addition, nearly 40% of the surveyed companies reported they would invest $5 million or more in blockchain in the coming year. Here are some of the most popular applications of blockchain being explored today.\\n\\n\\n  Bank Use  \\n\\nPerhaps no industry stands to benefit from integrating blockchain into its business operations more than banking. Financial institutions only operate during business hours, five days a week. That means if you try to deposit a check on Friday at 6 p.m., you likely will have to wait until Monday morning to see that money hit your account. Even if you do make your deposit during business hours, the transaction can still take one to three days to verify due to the sheer volume of transactions that banks need to settle. Blockchain, on the other hand, never sleeps.\\n\\n\\n\\nBy integrating blockchain into banks, consumers can see their transactions processed in as little as 10 minutes, basically the time it takes to add a block to the blockchain, regardless of the time or day of the week. With blockchain, banks also have the opportunity to exchange funds between institutions more quickly and securely. In the stock trading business, for example, the settlement and clearing process can take up to three days (or longer, if banks are trading internationally), meaning that the money and shares are frozen for that time.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the size of the sums involved, even the few days that the money is in transit can carry significant costs and risks for banks. Santander, a European bank, put the potential savings at $20 billion a year. Capgemini, a French consultancy, estimates that consumers could save up to $16 billion in banking and insurance fees each year through blockchain-based applications.\\n\\n\\n  Use in Cryptocurrency  \\n\\nBlockchain forms the bedrock for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. As we explored earlier, currencies like the U.S. dollar are regulated and verified by a central authority, usually a bank or government. Under the central authority system, a user\\xe2\\x80\\x99s data and currency are technically at the whim of their bank or government. If a user\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bank collapses or they live in a country with an unstable government, the value of their currency may be at risk. These are the worries out of which Bitcoin was borne.\\n\\n\\n\\nBy spreading its operations across a network of computers, blockchain allows Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to operate without the need for a central authority. This not only reduces risk but also eliminates many of the processing and transaction fees. It also gives those in countries with unstable currencies a more stable currency with more applications and a wider network of individuals and institutions they can do business with, both domestically and internationally (at least, this is the goal.)\\n\\n\\n  Healthcare Uses  \\n\\nHealth care providers can leverage blockchain to securely store their patients\\xe2\\x80\\x99 medical records. When a medical record is generated and signed, it can be written into the blockchain, which provides patients with the proof and confidence that the record cannot be changed. These personal health records could be encoded and stored on the blockchain with a private key, so that they are only accessible by certain individuals, thereby ensuring privacy\\n\\n\\n  Property Records Use  \\n\\nIf you have ever spent time in your local Recorder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Office, you will know that the process of recording property rights is both burdensome and inefficient. Today, a physical deed must be delivered to a government employee at the local recording office, where is it manually entered into the county\\xe2\\x80\\x99s central database and public index. In the case of a property dispute, claims to the property must be reconciled with the public index.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis process is not just costly and time-consuming\\xe2\\x80\\x94it is also riddled with human error, where each inaccuracy makes tracking property ownership less efficient. Blockchain has the potential to eliminate the need for scanning documents and tracking down physical files in a local recording office. If property ownership is stored and verified on the blockchain, owners can trust that their deed is accurate and permanent.\\n\\n\\n  Use in Smart Contracts  \\n\\nA smart contract is a computer code that can be built into the blockchain to facilitate, verify, or negotiate a contract agreement. Smart contracts operate under a set of conditions that users agree to. When those conditions are met, the terms of the agreement are automatically carried out.\\n\\n\\n\\nSay, for example, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m renting you my apartment using a smart contract. I agree to give you the door code to the apartment as soon as you pay me your security deposit. Both of us would send our portion of the deal to the smart contract, which would hold onto and automatically exchange my door code for your security deposit on the date of the rental. If I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t supply the door code by the rental date, the smart contract refunds your security deposit. This eliminates the fees that typically accompany using a notary or third-party mediator.\\n\\n\\n  Supply Chain Use\\xc2\\xa0  \\n\\nSuppliers can use blockchain to record the origins of materials that they have purchased. This would allow companies to verify the authenticity of their products, along with health and ethics labels like \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOrganic,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLocal,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFair Trade.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\nAs reported by Forbes the food industry is moving into the use of blockchain to increasingly track the path and safety of food throughout the farm-to-user journey.\\n\\n\\n  Uses in Voting\\xc2\\xa0  \\n\\nVoting with blockchain carries the potential to eliminate election fraud and boost voter turnout, as was tested in the Nov. 2018 midterm elections in West Virginia. Each vote would be stored as a block on the blockchain, making them nearly impossible to tamper with. The blockchain protocol would also maintain transparency in the electoral process, reducing the personnel needed to conduct an election and provide officials with instant results.\\n\\n\\n   Advantages and Disadvantages of Blockchain  \\n\\nFor all its complexity, blockchain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s potential as a decentralized form of record-keeping is almost without limit. From greater user privacy and heightened security to lower processing fees and fewer errors, blockchain technology may very well see applications beyond those outlined above.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPros\\n\\nImproved accuracy by removing human involvement in verification\\nCost reductions by eliminating third-party verification\\nDecentralization makes it harder to tamper with\\nTransactions are secure, private and efficient\\nTransparent technology\\n\\n\\n\\nCons\\n\\nSignificant technology cost associated with mining bitcoin\\nLow transactions per second\\nHistory of use in illicit activities\\nSusceptibility to being hacked\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere are the selling points of blockchain for businesses on the market today in more detail.\\n\\n\\n  Accuracy of the Chain  \\n\\nTransactions on the blockchain network are approved by a network of thousands or millions of computers. This removes almost all human involvement in the verification process, resulting in less human error and a more accurate record of information. Even if a computer on the network were to make a computational mistake, the error would only be made to one copy of the blockchain. In order for that error to spread to the rest of the blockchain, it would need to be made by at least 51% of the network\\xe2\\x80\\x99s computers\\xe2\\x80\\x94a near impossibility.\\n\\n\\n  Cost Reductions  \\n\\nTypically, consumers pay a bank to verify a transaction, a notary to sign a document, or a minister to perform a marriage. Blockchain eliminates the need for third-party verification and, with it, their associated costs. Business owners incur a small fee whenever they accept payments using credit cards, for example, because banks have to process those transactions. Bitcoin, on the other hand, does not have a central authority and has virtually no transaction fees.\\n\\n\\n  Decentralization  \\n\\nBlockchain does not store any of its information in a central location. Instead, the blockchain is copied and spread across a network of computers. Whenever a new block is added to the blockchain, every computer on the network updates its blockchain to reflect the change. By spreading that information across a network, rather than storing it in one central database, blockchain becomes more difficult to tamper with. If a copy of the blockchain fell into the hands of a hacker, only a single copy of the information, rather than the entire network, would be compromised.\\n\\n\\n  Efficient Transactions  \\n\\nTransactions placed through a central authority can take up to a few days to settle. If you attempt to deposit a check on Friday evening, for example, you may not actually see funds in your account until Monday morning. Whereas financial institutions operate during business hours, five days a week, blockchain is working 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Transactions can be completed in about ten minutes and can be considered secure after just a few hours. This is particularly useful for cross-border trades, which usually take much longer because of time-zone issues and the fact that all parties must confirm payment processing.\\n\\n\\n  Private Transactions  \\n\\nMany blockchain networks operate as public databases, meaning that anyone with an internet connection can view a list of the network\\xe2\\x80\\x99s transaction history. Although users can access details about transactions, they cannot access identifying information about the users making those transactions. It is a common misperception that blockchain networks like bitcoin are anonymous, when in fact they are only confidential.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat is, when a user makes public transactions, their unique code called a public key, is recorded on the blockchain, rather than their personal information. Although a person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s identity is still linked to their blockchain address, this prevents hackers from obtaining a user\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal information, as can occur when a bank is hacked.\\n\\n\\n  Secure Transactions  \\n\\nOnce a transaction is recorded, its authenticity must be verified by the blockchain network. Thousands or even millions of computers on the blockchain rush to confirm that the details of the purchase are correct. After a computer has validated the transaction, it is added to the blockchain in the form of a block. Each block on the blockchain contains its own unique hash, along with the unique hash of the block before it. When the information on a block is edited in any way, that block\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hash code changes\\xe2\\x80\\x94however, the hash code on the block after it would not. This discrepancy makes it extremely difficult for information on the blockchain to be changed without notice.\\n\\n\\n  Transparency  \\n\\nEven though personal information on the blockchain is kept private, the technology itself is almost always open source. That means that users on the blockchain network can modify the code as they see fit, so long as they have a majority of the network\\xe2\\x80\\x99s computational power backing them. Keeping data on the blockchain open source also makes tampering with data that much more difficult. With millions of computers on the blockchain network at any given time, for example, it is unlikely that anyone could make a change without being noticed.\\n\\n\\n   Disadvantages of Blockchain  \\n\\nWhile there are significant upsides to the blockchain, there are also significant challenges to its adoption. The roadblocks to the application of blockchain technology today are not just technical. The real challenges are political and regulatory, for the most part, to say nothing of the thousands of hours (read: money) of custom software design and back-end programming required to integrate blockchain to current business networks. Here are some of the challenges standing in the way of widespread blockchain adoption.\\n\\n\\n  Technology Cost  \\n\\nAlthough blockchain can save users money on transaction fees, the technology is far from free. The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cproof of work\\xe2\\x80\\x9d system that bitcoin uses to validate transactions, for example, consumes vast amounts of computational power. In the real world, the power from the millions of computers on the bitcoin network is close to what Denmark consumes annually. All of that energy costs money and according to a recent study from research company Elite Fixtures, the cost of mining a single bitcoin varies drastically by location, from just $531 to a staggering $26,170.\\n\\n\\n\\nBased on average utility costs in the United States, that figure is closer to $4,758. Despite the costs of mining bitcoin, users continue to drive up their electricity bills in order to validate transactions on the blockchain. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because when miners add a block to the bitcoin blockchain, they are rewarded with enough bitcoin to make their time and energy worthwhile. When it comes to blockchains that do not use cryptocurrency, however, miners will need to be paid or otherwise incentivized to validate transactions.\\n\\n\\n  Speed Inefficiency  \\n\\nBitcoin is a perfect case study for the possible inefficiencies of blockchain. Bitcoin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cproof of work\\xe2\\x80\\x9d system takes about ten minutes to add a new block to the blockchain. At that rate, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s estimated that the blockchain network can only manage seven transactions per second (TPS). Although other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (20 TPS) and Bitcoin Cash (60 TPS) perform better than bitcoin, they are still limited by blockchain. Legacy brand Visa, for context, can process 24,000 TPS.\\n\\n\\n  Illegal Activity  \\n\\nWhile confidentiality on the blockchain network protects users from hacks and preserves privacy, it also allows for illegal trading and activity on the blockchain network. The most cited example of blockchain being used for illicit transactions is probably Silk Road, an online \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdark web\\xe2\\x80\\x9d marketplace operating from Feb. 2011 until Oct. 2013 when it was shut down by the FBI.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe website allowed users to browse the website without being tracked and make illegal purchases in bitcoins. Current U.S. regulation prevents users of online exchanges, like those built on blockchain, from full anonymity. In the United States, online exchanges must obtain information about their customers when they open an account, verify the identity of each customer, and confirm that customers do not appear on any list of known or suspected terrorist organizations.\\n\\n\\n  Central Bank Concerns  \\n\\nSeveral central banks, including the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, have launched investigations into digital currencies. According to a Feb. 2015 Bank of England research report, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFurther research would also be required to devise a system which could utilize distributed ledger technology without compromising a central bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to control its currency and secure the system against systemic attack.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n  Hack Susceptibility  \\n\\nNewer cryptocurrencies and blockchain networks are susceptible to 51% attacks. These attacks are extremely difficult to execute due to the computational power required to gain majority control of a blockchain network, but NYU computer science researcher Joseph Bonneau said that might change. Bonneau released a report last year estimating that 51% attacks were likely to increase, as hackers can now simply rent computational power, rather than buying all of the equipment.\\n\\n\\n   What\\'s Next for Blockchain?  \\n\\nFirst proposed as a research project in 1991, blockchain is comfortably settling into its late twenties. Like most millennials its age, blockchain has seen its fair share of public scrutiny over the last two decades, with businesses around the world speculating about what the technology is capable of and where it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s headed in the years to come.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith many practical applications for the technology already being implemented and explored, blockchain is finally making a name for itself at age twenty-seven, in no small part because of bitcoin and cryptocurrency. As a buzzword on the tongue of every investor in the nation, blockchain stands to make business and government operations more accurate, efficient, and secure.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs we prepare to head into the third decade of blockchain, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no longer a question of \"if\" legacy companies will catch on to the technology\\xe2\\x80\\x94it\\'s a question of \"when.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nArticle Sources\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

(Discuss) Proposed since April 2020.\\ndistributed data store for digital transactions\\n\\n\\n Blockchain formation. The main chain (black) consists of the longest series of blocks from the genesis block (green) to the current block. Orphan blocks (purple) exist outside of the main chain. Bitcoin network data\\nA blockchain,[1][2][3] originally block chain,[4][5] is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked using cryptography.[1][6] Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block,[6] a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree).\\nBy design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data. It is \"an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way\".[7] For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for inter-node communication and validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus of the network majority. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance. Decentralized consensus has therefore been claimed with a blockchain.[8]\\nBlockchain was invented by a person (or group of people) using the name Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public transaction ledger of the cryptocurrency bitcoin.[1] The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains unknown to date. The invention of the blockchain for bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server. The bitcoin design has inspired other applications,[1][3] and blockchains that are readable by the public are widely used by cryptocurrencies. Blockchain is considered a type of payment rail.[9] Private blockchains have been proposed for business use. Sources such as Computerworld called the marketing of such blockchains without a proper security model \"snake oil\".[10]\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 History\\n2 Structure\\n\\n2.1 Blocks\\n\\n2.1.1 Block time\\n2.1.2 Hard forks\\n\\n\\n2.2 Decentralization\\n2.3 Openness\\n\\n2.3.1 Permissionless\\n2.3.2 Permissioned (private) blockchain\\n2.3.3 Disadvantages of private blockchain\\n2.3.4 Blockchain analysis\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3 Uses\\n\\n3.1 Cryptocurrencies\\n3.2 Smart contracts\\n3.3 Financial services\\n3.4 Video games\\n3.5 Energy trading\\n3.6 Supply chain\\n3.7 Domain Names\\n3.8 Other uses\\n\\n\\n4 Types\\n\\n4.1 Public blockchains\\n4.2 Private blockchains\\n4.3 Hybrid blockchains\\n4.4 Sidechains\\n\\n\\n5 Academic research\\n\\n5.1 Adoption decision\\n5.2 Collaboration\\n5.3 Blockchain and internal audit\\n5.4 Energy use of proof-of-work blockchains\\n5.5 Journals\\n\\n\\n6 See also\\n7 References\\n8 Further reading\\n9 External links\\n\\n\\n\\nHistory\\n Bitcoin transactions (January 2009 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 September 2017)\\nCryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his 1982 dissertation \"Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups.\"[11] Further work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.[6][12] They wanted to implement a system where document timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave Bayer incorporated Merkle trees to the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block.[6][13]\\nThe first blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a Hashcash-like method to timestamp blocks without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party and introducing a difficulty parameter to stabilize rate with which blocks are added to the chain.[6] The design was implemented the following year by Nakamoto as a core component of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions on the network.[1]\\nIn August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of all transactions that have occurred on the network, reached 20\\xc2\\xa0GB (gigabytes).[14] In January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30\\xc2\\xa0GB, and from January 2016 to January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50\\xc2\\xa0GB to 100\\xc2\\xa0GB in size.  The ledger size had exceeded 200 GiB by early 2020.[15]\\nThe words block and chain were used separately in Satoshi Nakamoto\\'s original paper, but were eventually popularized as a single word, blockchain, by 2016.\\nAccording to Accenture, an application of the diffusion of innovations theory suggests that blockchains attained a 13.5% adoption rate within financial services in 2016, therefore reaching the early adopters phase.[16] Industry trade groups joined to create the Global Blockchain Forum in 2016, an initiative of the Chamber of Digital Commerce.\\nIn May 2018, Gartner found that only 1% of CIOs indicated any kind of blockchain adoption within their organisations, and only 8% of CIOs were in the short-term \"planning or [looking at] active experimentation with blockchain\".[17]\\n\\nStructure\\nA blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and oftentimes public, digital ledger consisting of records called blocks that is used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved block cannot be altered retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.[1][18] This allows the participants to verify and audit transactions independently and relatively inexpensively.[19] A blockchain database is managed autonomously using a peer-to-peer network and a distributed timestamping server. They are authenticated by mass collaboration powered by collective self-interests.[20] Such a design facilitates robust workflow where participants\\' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal. The use of a blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double spending. A blockchain has been described as a value-exchange protocol.[21] A blockchain can maintain title rights because, when properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels offer and acceptance.\\n\\nBlocks\\nBlocks hold batches of valid transactions that are hashed and encoded into a Merkle tree.[1] Each block includes the cryptographic hash of the prior block in the blockchain, linking the two. The linked blocks form a chain.[1] This iterative process confirms the integrity of the previous block, all the way back to the original genesis block.[22]\\nSometimes separate blocks can be produced concurrently, creating a temporary fork. In addition to a secure hash-based history, any blockchain has a specified algorithm for scoring different versions of the history so that one with a higher score can be selected over others. Blocks not selected for inclusion in the chain are called orphan blocks.[22] Peers supporting the database have different versions of the history from time to time. They keep only the highest-scoring version of the database known to them. Whenever a peer receives a higher-scoring version (usually the old version with a single new block added) they extend or overwrite their own database and retransmit the improvement to their peers. There is never an absolute guarantee that any particular entry will remain in the best version of the history forever. Blockchains are typically built to add the score of new blocks onto old blocks and are given incentives to extend with new blocks rather than overwrite old blocks. Therefore, the probability of an entry becoming superseded decreases exponentially[23] as more blocks are built on top of it, eventually becoming very low.[1][24]:ch. 08[25] For example, bitcoin uses a proof-of-work system, where the chain with the most cumulative proof-of-work is considered the valid one by the network. There are a number of methods that can be used to demonstrate a sufficient level of computation. Within a blockchain the computation is carried out redundantly rather than in the traditional segregated and parallel manner.[26]\\n\\nBlock time\\nThe block time is the average time it takes for the network to generate one extra block in the blockchain. Some blockchains create a new block as frequently as every five seconds. By the time of block completion, the included data becomes verifiable. In cryptocurrency, this is practically when the transaction takes place, so a shorter block time means faster transactions. The block time for Ethereum is set to between 14 and 15 seconds, while for bitcoin it is on average 10 minutes.[27]\\n\\nHard forks\\nThis section is an excerpt from Fork (blockchain) \\xc2\\xa7 Hard fork[edit]\\nA hard fork is a rule change such that the software validating according to the old rules will see the blocks produced according to the new rules as invalid. In case of a hard fork, all nodes meant to work in accordance with the new rules need to upgrade their software.\\n\\nIf one group of nodes continues to use the old software while the other nodes use the new software, a permanent split can occur. For example, Ethereum has hard-forked to \"make whole\" the investors in The DAO, which had been hacked by exploiting a vulnerability in its code. In this case, the fork resulted in a split creating Ethereum and Ethereum Classic chains. In 2014 the Nxt community was asked to consider a hard fork that would have led to a rollback of the blockchain records to mitigate the effects of a theft of 50 million NXT from a major cryptocurrency exchange. The hard fork proposal was rejected, and some of the funds were recovered after negotiations and ransom payment. Alternatively, to prevent a permanent split, a majority of nodes using the new software may return to the old rules, as was the case of bitcoin split on 12 March 2013.[28]\\nDecentralization\\nBy storing data across its peer-to-peer network, the blockchain eliminates a number of risks that come with data being held centrally.[1] The decentralized blockchain may use ad hoc message passing and distributed networking.\\nPeer-to-peer blockchain networks lack centralized points of vulnerability that computer crackers can exploit; likewise, it has no central point of failure. Blockchain security methods include the use of public-key cryptography.[4]:5 A public key (a long, random-looking string of numbers) is an address on the blockchain. Value tokens sent across the network are recorded as belonging to that address. A private key is like a password that gives its owner access to their digital assets or the means to otherwise interact with the various capabilities that blockchains now support. Data stored on the blockchain is generally considered incorruptible.[1]\\nEvery node in a decentralized system has a copy of the blockchain. Data quality is maintained by massive database replication[8] and computational trust. No centralized \"official\" copy exists and no user is \"trusted\" more than any other.[4] Transactions are broadcast to the network using software. Messages are delivered on a best-effort basis. Mining nodes validate transactions,[22] add them to the block they are building, and then broadcast the completed block to other nodes.[24]:ch. 08 Blockchains use various time-stamping schemes, such as proof-of-work, to serialize changes.[29] Alternative consensus methods include proof-of-stake.[22] Growth of a decentralized blockchain is accompanied by the risk of centralization because the computer resources required to process larger amounts of data become more expensive.[30]\\n\\nOpenness\\nOpen blockchains are more user-friendly than some traditional ownership records, which, while open to the public, still require physical access to view. Because all early blockchains were permissionless, controversy has arisen over the blockchain definition. An issue in this ongoing debate is whether a private system with verifiers tasked and authorized (permissioned) by a central authority should be considered a blockchain.[31][32][33][34][35] Proponents of permissioned or private chains argue that the term \"blockchain\" may be applied to any data structure that batches data into time-stamped blocks. These blockchains serve as a distributed version of multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) in databases.[36] Just as MVCC prevents two transactions from concurrently modifying a single object in a database, blockchains prevent two transactions from spending the same single output in a blockchain.[37]:30\\xe2\\x80\\x9331 Opponents say that permissioned systems resemble traditional corporate databases, not supporting decentralized data verification, and that such systems are not hardened against operator tampering and revision.[31][33] Nikolai Hampton of Computerworld said that \"many in-house blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome databases,\" and \"without a clear security model, proprietary blockchains should be eyed with suspicion.\"[10][38]\\n\\nPermissionless\\nThe great advantage to an open, permissionless, or public, blockchain network is that guarding against bad actors is not required and no access control is needed.[23] This means that applications can be added to the network without the approval or trust of others, using the blockchain as a transport layer.[23]\\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies currently secure their blockchain by requiring new entries to include a proof of work. To prolong the blockchain, bitcoin uses Hashcash puzzles. While Hashcash was designed in 1997 by Adam Back, the original idea was first proposed by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor and Eli Ponyatovski in their 1992 paper \"Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail\".\\nIn 2016, venture capital investment for blockchain-related projects was weakening in the USA but increasing in China.[39] Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies use open (public) blockchains. As of April\\xc2\\xa02018[update], bitcoin has the highest market capitalization.\\n\\nPermissioned (private) blockchain\\nSee also: Distributed ledger\\nPermissioned blockchains use an access control layer to govern who has access to the network.[40] In contrast to public blockchain networks, validators on private blockchain networks are vetted by the network owner. They do not rely on anonymous nodes to validate transactions nor do they benefit from the network effect.[citation needed] Permissioned blockchains can also go by the name of \\'consortium\\' blockchains.[citation needed]\\n\\nDisadvantages of private blockchain\\nNikolai Hampton pointed out in Computerworld that \"There is also no need for a \\'51 percent\\' attack on a private blockchain, as the private blockchain (most likely) already controls 100 percent of all block creation resources. If you could attack or damage the blockchain creation tools on a private corporate server, you could effectively control 100 percent of their network and alter transactions however you wished.\"[10] This has a set of particularly profound adverse implications during a financial crisis or debt crisis like the financial crisis of 2007\\xe2\\x80\\x9308, where politically powerful actors may make decisions that favor some groups at the expense of others,[41][42] and \"the bitcoin blockchain is protected by the massive group mining effort. It\\'s unlikely that any private blockchain will try to protect records using gigawatts of computing power \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it\\'s time consuming and expensive.\"[10] He also said, \"Within a private blockchain there is also no \\'race\\'; there\\'s no incentive to use more power or discover blocks faster than competitors. This means that many in-house blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome databases.\"[10]\\n\\nBlockchain analysis\\nThe analysis of public blockchains has become increasingly important with the popularity of bitcoin, Ethereum, litecoin and other cryptocurrencies.[43] A blockchain, if it is public, provides anyone who wants access to observe and analyse the chain data, given one has the know-how. The process of understanding and accessing the flow of crypto has been an issue for many cryptocurrencies, crypto-exchanges and banks.[44][45] The reason for this is accusations of blockchain enabled cryptocurrencies enabling illicit dark market trade of drugs, weapons, money laundering etc.[46] A common belief has been that cryptocurrency is private and untraceable, thus leading many actors to use it for illegal purposes. This is changing and now specialised tech-companies provide blockchain tracking services, making crypto exchanges, law-enforcement and banks more aware of what is happening with crypto funds and fiat crypto exchanges. The development, some argue, has led criminals to prioritise use of new cryptos such as Monero.[47][48][49] The question is about public accessibility of blockchain data and the personal privacy of the very same data. It is a key debate in cryptocurrency and ultimately in blockchain.[50]\\n\\nUses\\nBlockchain technology can be integrated into multiple areas. The primary use of blockchains today is as a distributed ledger for cryptocurrencies, most notably bitcoin. There are a few operational products maturing from proof of concept by late 2016.[39] Businesses have been thus far reluctant to place blockchain at the core of the business structure.[51]\\n\\nCryptocurrencies\\nMain article: Cryptocurrency\\nMost cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology to record transactions. For example, the bitcoin network and Ethereum network are both based on blockchain. On 8 May 2018 Facebook confirmed that it would open a new blockchain group[52] which would be headed by David Marcus, who previously was in charge of Messenger. Facebook\\'s planned cryptocurrency platform, Libra, was formally announced on June 18, 2019.[53][54]\\n\\nSmart contracts\\nMain article: Smart contract\\nBlockchain-based smart contracts are proposed contracts that can be partially or fully executed or enforced without human interaction.[55] One of the main objectives of a smart contract is automated escrow. An IMF staff discussion reported that smart contracts based on blockchain technology might reduce moral hazards and optimize the use of contracts in general. But \"no viable smart contract systems have yet emerged.\" Due to the lack of widespread use their legal status is unclear.[56][57]\\n\\nFinancial services\\nMajor portions of the financial industry are implementing distributed ledgers for use in banking,[58][59][60] and according to a September 2016 IBM study, this is occurring faster than expected.[61]\\nBanks are interested in this technology because it has potential to speed up back office settlement systems.[62]\\nBanks such as UBS are opening new research labs dedicated to blockchain technology in order to explore how blockchain can be used in financial services to increase efficiency and reduce costs.[63][64]\\nBerenberg, a German bank, believes that blockchain is an \"overhyped technology\" that has had a large number of \"proofs of concept\", but still has major challenges, and very few success stories.[65]\\nIn December 2018, Bitwala launched Europe\\'s first regulated blockchain banking solution that enables users to manage both their bitcoin and euro deposits in one place with the safety and convenience of a German bank account. The bank account is hosted by the Berlin-based solarisBank.[66]\\nThe blockchain has also given rise to Initial coin offerings (ICOs) as well as a new category of digital asset called Security Token Offerings (STOs), also sometimes referred to as Digital Security Offerings (DSOs).[67] STO/DSOs may be conducted privately or on a public, regulated stock exchange and are used to tokenize traditional assets such as company shares as well as more innovative ones like intellectual property, real estate, art, or individual products. A number of companies are active in this space providing services for compliant tokenization, private STOs, and public STOs.\\n\\nVideo games\\nA blockchain game CryptoKitties, launched in November 2017.[68] The game made headlines in December 2017 when a cryptokitty character - an in-game virtual pet - was sold for more than US$100,000.[69] CryptoKitties illustrated scalability problems for games on Ethereum when it created significant congestion on the Ethereum network with about 30% of all Ethereum transactions being for the game.[70]\\nCryptoKitties also demonstrated how blockchains can be used to catalog game assets (digital assets).[71]\\n\\nEnergy trading\\nBlockchain is also being used in peer-to-peer energy trading.[72][73][74]\\n\\nSupply chain\\nThere are a number of efforts and industry organizations working to employ blockchains in supply chain management.\\nEverledger is one of the inaugural clients of IBM\\'s blockchain-based tracking service.[75]\\nWalmart and IBM are running a trial to use a blockchain-backed system for supply chain monitoring \\xe2\\x80\\x94 all nodes of the blockchain are administered by Walmart and are located on the IBM cloud.[76]\\nHyperledger Grid develops open components for blockchain supply chain solutions.[77][78]\\n\\nDomain Names\\nBlockchain domain names are another use of blockchain on the rise. Unlike regular domain names, blockchain domain names are entirely an asset of the domain owner and can only be controlled by the owner through a private key.[79] Blockchain domains, pave way to having sites that are more resistant to censorship and thus enabling freedom of speech as there are no authorities or individuals that can intervene on controlling a domain except the private key holder.[80][81] Again, they are a better option to replace the traditional cryptocurrency wallet addresses as one can easily memorize the domain and use it for receiving payments.[82]\\nOrganizations providing blockchain domain name services include Unstoppable Domains, Namecoin and Ethereum Name Services.[83]\\n\\nOther uses\\nBlockchain technology can be used to create a permanent, public, transparent ledger system for compiling data on sales, tracking digital use and payments to content creators, such as wireless users[84] or musicians.[85] In 2017, IBM partnered with ASCAP and PRS for Music to adopt blockchain technology in music distribution.[86] Imogen Heap\\'s Mycelia service has also been proposed as blockchain-based alternative \"that gives artists more control over how their songs and associated data circulate among fans and other musicians.\"[87][88]\\nNew distribution methods are available for the insurance industry such as peer-to-peer insurance, parametric insurance and microinsurance following the adoption of blockchain.[89][90] The sharing economy and IoT are also set to benefit from blockchains because they involve many collaborating peers.[91] Online voting is another application of the blockchain.[92][93] The use of blockchain in libraries is being studied with a grant from the U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services.[94]\\nOther designs include:\\n\\nHyperledger is a cross-industry collaborative effort from the Linux Foundation to support blockchain-based distributed ledgers, with projects under this initiative including Hyperledger Burrow (by Monax) and Hyperledger Fabric (spearheaded by IBM).[95]\\nQuorum \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a permissionable private blockchain by JPMorgan Chase with private storage, used for contract applications.[96]\\nTezos, decentralized voting.[37]:94\\nDigital Asset Modeling Language (DAML) by Digital Asset Holdings is a smart contract language based on Glasgow Haskell Compiler.\\nProof of Existence is an online service that verifies the existence of computer files as of a specific time.[97]\\nTypes\\nCurrently, there are at least four types of blockchain networks \\xe2\\x80\\x94 public blockchains, private blockchains, consortium blockchains and hybrid blockchains.\\n\\nPublic blockchains\\nA public blockchain has absolutely no access restrictions. Anyone with an Internet connection can send transactions to it as well as become a validator (i.e., participate in the execution of a consensus protocol).[98][self-published source?] Usually, such networks offer economic incentives for those who secure them and utilize some type of a Proof of Stake or Proof of Work algorithm.\\nSome of the largest, most known public blockchains are the bitcoin blockchain and the Ethereum blockchain.\\n\\nPrivate blockchains\\nA private blockchain is permissioned.[40] One cannot join it unless invited by the network administrators. Participant and validator access is restricted.\\n\\nHybrid blockchains\\nA hybrid blockchain has a combination of centralized and decentralized features.[99] The exact workings of the chain can vary based on which portions of centralization decentralization are used.\\n\\nSidechains\\nA sidechain is a designation for a blockchain ledger that runs in parallel to a primary blockchain.[100][101] Entries from the primary blockchain (where said entries typically represent digital assets) can be linked to and from the sidechain; this allows the sidechain to otherwise operate independently of the primary blockchain (e.g., by using an alternate means of record keeping, alternate consensus algorithm, etc.).[102]\\n\\nAcademic research\\n Blockchain panel discussion at the first IEEE Computer Society TechIgnite conference\\nIn October 2014, the MIT Bitcoin Club, with funding from MIT alumni, provided undergraduate students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology access to $100 of bitcoin. The adoption rates, as studied by Catalini and Tucker (2016), revealed that when people who typically adopt technologies early are given delayed access, they tend to reject the technology.[103]\\n\\nAdoption decision\\nMotivations for adopting blockchain technology have been investigated by researchers. Janssen et al. provided a framework for analysis.[104] Koens & Poll pointed out that adoption could be heavily driven by non-technical factors.[105] Based on behavioral models, Li[106] discussed the differences between adoption at individual level and at organization level.\\n\\nCollaboration\\nScholars in business and management have started studying the role of blockchains to support collaboration.[107][108] It has been argued that blockchains can foster both cooperation (i.e., prevention of opportunistic behavior) and coordination (i.e., communication and information sharing). Thanks to reliability, transparency, traceability of records, and information immutability, blockchains facilitate collaboration in a way that differs both from the traditional use of contracts and from relational norms.[109] Contrary to contracts, blockchains do not directly rely on the legal system to enforce agreements. In addition, contrary to the use of relational norms, blockchains do not require trust or direct connections between collaborators.\\n\\nBlockchain and internal audit\\nThe need for internal audit to provide effective oversight of organizational efficiency will require a change in the way that  information  is accessed in new formats.[110] Blockchain adoption requires a framework to identify the risk of exposure associated with transactions using blockchain. The Institute of Internal Auditors has identified the need for internal auditors to address this transformational technology.  New methods are required to develop audit plans that identify threats and risks. The Internal Audit Foundation study, Blockchain and Internal Audit, assesses these factors.[111] The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants has outlined new roles for auditors as a result of blockchain.[112]\\n\\nEnergy use of proof-of-work blockchains\\nExternal video Cryptocurrencies: looking beyond the hype, Hyun Song Shin, Bank for International Settlements, 2:48[113] Blockchains and Cryptocurrencies: Burn It With Fire, Nicholas Weaver, Berkeley School of Information, 49:47, lecture begins at 3:05[114]\\nThe Bank for International Settlements has criticized the public proof-of-work blockchains for high energy consumption.[115][113][116] Nicholas Weaver, of the International Computer Science Institute at the University of California, Berkeley examines blockchain\\'s online security, and the energy efficiency of proof-of-work public blockchains, and in both cases finds it grossly inadequate.[114][117] The 31\\xe2\\x80\\x9445 TWh of electricity used for bitcoin in 2018 produced 17\\xe2\\x80\\x9422.9 MtCO2.[118][119]\\n\\nJournals\\nMain article: Ledger (journal)\\nIn September 2015, the first peer-reviewed academic journal dedicated to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology research, Ledger, was announced.

For consumers, this means interacting with the global information network without the intermediary of a keyboard and screen; many of their everyday objects and appliances can take instructions from that network with minimal human intervention.\\n[ More IoT coverage of Network World ]In enterprise settings, IoT can bring the same efficiencies to physical manufacturing and distribution that the internet has long delivered for knowledge work. Millions if not billions of embedded internet-enabled sensors worldwide are providing an incredibly rich set of data that companies can use to gather data about their safety of their operations, track assets and reduce manual processes. Researchers can also use the IoT to gather data about people\\'s preferences and behavior, though that can have serious implications for privacy and security.How big is it?In a word: enormous. Priceonomics breaks it down: There are more than 50 billion IoT devices as of 2020, and those devices will generate 4.4 zettabytes of data this year. (A zettabyte is a trillion gigabytes.) By comparison, in 2013 IoT devices generated a mere 100 billion gigabytes. The amount of money to be made in the IoT market is similarly staggering; estimates on the value of the market in 2025 range from $1.6 trillion to $14.4 trillion. History of IoTA world of omnipresent connected devices and sensors is one of the oldest tropes of science fiction. IoT lore has dubbed a vending machine at Carnegie Mellon that was connected to APRANET in 1970 as the first Internet of Things device, and many technologies have been touted as enabling \"smart\" IoT-style characteristics to give them a futuristic sheen. But the term Internet of Things was coined in 1999 by British technologist \\xc2\\xa0Kevin Ashton.\\nAt first, the technology lagged behind the vision. Every internet-connected thing needed a processor and a means to communicate with other things, preferably wirelessly, and those factors imposed costs and power requirements that made widespread IoT rollouts impractical, at least until Moore\\'s Law caught up in the mid \\'00s. One important milestone was widespread adoption of RFID tags, cheap minimalist transponders that could be stuck on any object to connect it to the larger internet world. Omnipresent Wi-Fi and 4G made it possible to for designers to simply assume wireless connectivity anywhere. And the rollout of IPv6 means that connecting billions of gadgets to the internet won\\'t exhaust the store of IP addresses, which was a real concern. (Related story: Can IoT networking drive adoption of IPv6?)How does the IoT work?The basic elements of the IoT are devices that gather data. Broadly speaking, they are internet-connected devices, so they each have an IP address. They range in complexity from autonomous vehicles that haul products around factory floors to simple sensors that monitor the temperature in buildings. They also include personal devices like fitness trackers that monitor the number of steps individuals take each day. To make that data useful it needs to be collected, processed, filtered and analyzed, each of which can be handled in a variety of ways.Collecting the data is done by transmitting it from the devices to a gathering point. Moving the data can be done wirelessly using a range of technologies or on wired networks. The data can be sent over the internet to a data center or a cloud that has storage and compute power or the transfer can be staged, with intermediary devices aggregating the data before sending it along.Processing the data can take place in data centers or cloud, but sometimes that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not an option. In the case of critical devices such as shutoffs in industrial settings, the delay of sending data from the device to a remote data center is too great. The round-trip time for sending data, processing it, analyzing it and returning instructions (close that valve before the pipes burst) can take too long. In such cases edge-computing can come into play, where a smart edge device can aggregate data, analyze it and fashion responses if necessary, all within relatively close physical distance, thereby reducing delay. Edge devices also have upstream connectivity for sending data to be further processed and stored.  Network World / IDG\\n\\nHow the internet of things works.\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\nExamples of IoT devices Essentially, anything that\\'s capable of gathering some information about the physical world and sending it back home can participate in the IoT ecosystem. Smart home appliances, RFID tags, and industrial sensors are a few examples. These sensors can monitor a range of factors including temperature and pressure in industrial systems, status of critical parts in machinery, patient vital signs, and use of water and electricity, among many, many other possibilities.Entire factory robots can be considered IoT devices, as can autonomous vehicles that move products around industrial settings and warehouses.Other examples include fitness wearables and home security systems. There are also more generic devices, like the Raspberry Pi or Arduino, that let you build your own IoT end points. Even though you might think of your smartphone as a pocket-sized computer, it may well also be beaming data about your location and behavior to back-end services in very IoT-like ways.Device managementIn order to work together, all those devices need to be authenticated, provisioned, configured, and monitored, as well as patched and updated as necessary. Too often, all this happens within the context of a single vendor\\'s proprietary systems \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or, it doesn\\'t happen at all, which is even more risky. But the industry is starting to transition to a standards-based device management model, which allows IoT devices to interoperate and will ensure that devices aren\\'t orphaned.IoT communication standards and protocolsWhen IoT gadgets talk to other devices, they can use a wide variety of communications standards and protocols, many tailored to devices with limited processing capabilities or not much electrical power. Some of these you\\'ve definitely heard of \\xe2\\x80\\x94 some devices use Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, for instance \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but many more are specialized for the world of IoT. ZigBee, for instance, is a wireless protocol for low-power, short-distance communication, while message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) is a publish/subscribe messaging protocol for devices connected by unreliable or delay-prone networks. (See Network World\\xe2\\x80\\x99s glossary of IoT standards and protocols.)The increased speeds and bandwidth of the coming 5G standard for cellular networks will also benefit IoT, though that usage will lag behind ordinary cell phones.IoT, edge computing and the cloud Network World / IDG\\n\\nHow edge computing enables IoT.\\n\\nFor many IoT systems, there\\'s a lot of data coming in fast and furious, which has given rise to a new technology category, edge computing, consisting of appliances placed relatively close to IoT devices, fielding the flow of data from them. These machines process that data and send only relevant material back to a more centralized system for analysis. For instance, imagine a network of dozens of IoT security cameras. Instead of bombarding the building\\'s security operations center (SoC) with simultaneous live-streams, edge-computing systems can analyze the incoming video and only alert the SoC when one of the cameras detects movement.And where does that data go once it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been processed? Well, it might go to your centralized data center, but more often than not it will end up in the cloud.The elastic nature of cloud computing is great for IoT scenarios where data might come in intermittently or asynchronously. And many of the big cloud heavy hitters \\xe2\\x80\\x94 including Google, Microsoft, and Amazon \\xe2\\x80\\x94 have IoT offerings.\\xc2\\xa0IoT platformsThe cloud giants are trying to sell more than just a place to stash the data your sensors have collected. They\\'re offering full IoT platforms, which bundle together much of the functionality to coordinate the elements that make up IoT systems. In essence, an IoT platform serves as middleware that connects the IoT devices and edge gateways with the applications you use to deal with the IoT data. That said, every platform vendor seems to have a slightly different definition of what an IoT platform is, the better to distance themselves from the competition.IoT and dataAs mentioned, there are zettabytes of data being collected by all those IoT devices, funneled through edge gateways, and sent to a platform for processing. In many scenarios, this data is the reason IoT has been deployed in the first place. By collecting information from sensors in the real world, organizations can make nimble decisions in real time.Oracle, for instance, imagines a scenario where people at a theme park are encouraged to download an app that offers information about the park. At the same time, the app sends GPS pings back to the park\\'s management to help predict wait times in lines. With that information, the park can take action in the short term (by adding more staff to increase the capacity of some attractions, for instance) and the long term (by learning which rides are the most and least popular at the park).These decisions can be made without human intervention. For example, data gathered from pressure sensors in a chemical-factory pipeline could be analyzed by software in an edge device that spots the threat of a pipeline rupture, and that information can trigger a signal to shut valves to avert a spill.\\xc2\\xa0IoT and big data analyticsThe theme park example is easy to get your head around, but is small potatoes compared to many real-world IoT data-harvesting operations. Many big data operations use information harvested from IoT devices, correlated with other data points, to get insight into human behavior. Software Advice gives a few examples, including a service from Birst that matches coffee brewing information collected from internet-connected coffeemakers with social media posts to see if customers are talking about coffee brands online.Another dramatic example came recently when X-Mode released a map based on tracking location data of people who partied at spring break in Ft. Lauderdale in March of 2020, even as the coronavirus pandemic was gaining speed in the United States, showing where all those people ended up across the country. The map was shocking not only because it showed the potential spread of the virus, but also because it illustrated just how closely IoT devices can track us. (For more on IoT and analytics, click here.IoT data and AIThe volume of data IoT devices can gather is far larger than any human can deal with in a useful way, and certainly not in real time. We\\'ve already seen that edge computing devices are needed just to make sense of the raw data coming in from the IoT endpoints. There\\'s also the need to detect and deal with data that might be just plain wrong.Many IoT providers are offering machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities to make sense of the collected data. IBM\\'s Jeopardy!-winning Watson platform, for instance, can be trained on IoT data sets to produce useful results in the field of predicative maintenance \\xe2\\x80\\x94 analyzing data from drones to distinguish between trivial damage to a bridge and cracks that need attention, for instance. Meanwhile, Arm is working on low-power chips that can provide AI capabilities on the IoT endpoints themselves. \\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0IoT and businessBusiness uses for IoT include keeping track of customers, inventory, and the status of important components.

Sometimes, these devices communicate with other related devices and act on the information they get from one another. The devices do most of the work without human intervention, although people can interact with the devices -- for instance, to set them up, give them instructions or access the data.\\nThe connectivity, networking and communication protocols used with these web-enabled devices largely depend on the specific IoT applications deployed.\\nIoT can also make use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to aid in making data collecting processes easier and more dynamic.\\n\\n\\n\\nAn example of how an IoT system works from collecting data to taking action\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy IoT is important\\nThe internet of things helps people live and work smarter, as well as gain complete control over their lives. In addition to offering smart devices to automate homes, IoT is essential to business. IoT provides businesses with a real-time look into how their systems really work, delivering insights into everything from the performance of machines to supply chain and logistics operations.\\nIoT enables companies to automate processes and reduce labor costs. It also cuts down on waste and improves service delivery, making it less expensive to manufacture and deliver goods, as well as offering transparency into customer transactions.\\nAs such, IoT is one of the most important technologies of everyday life, and it will continue to pick up steam as more businesses realize the potential of connected devices to keep them competitive.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIoT benefits to organizations\\nThe internet of things offers several benefits to organizations. Some benefits are industry-specific, and some are applicable across multiple industries. Some of the common benefits of IoT enable businesses to:\\n\\nmonitor their overall business processes;\\nimprove the customer experience (CX);\\nsave time and money;\\nenhance employee productivity;\\nintegrate and adapt business models;\\nmake better business decisions; and\\ngenerate more revenue.\\n\\nIoT encourages companies to rethink the ways they approach their businesses and gives them the tools to improve their business strategies.\\nGenerally, IoT is most abundant in manufacturing, transportation and utility organizations, making use of sensors and other IoT devices; however, it has also found use cases for organizations within the agriculture, infrastructure and home automation industries, leading some organizations toward digital transformation.\\nIoT can benefit farmers in agriculture by making their job easier. Sensors can collect data on rainfall, humidity, temperature and soil content, as well as other factors, that would help automate farming techniques.\\nThe ability to monitor operations surrounding infrastructure is also a factor that IoT can help with. Sensors, for example, could be used to monitor events or changes within structural buildings, bridges and other infrastructure. This brings benefits with it, such as cost saving, saved time, quality-of-life workflow changes and paperless workflow.\\nA home automation business can utilize IoT to monitor and manipulate mechanical and electrical systems in a building. On a broader scale, smart cities\\xc2\\xa0can help citizens reduce waste and energy consumption.\\nIoT touches every industry, including businesses within healthcare, finance, retail and manufacturing.\\n\\n\\nPros and cons of IoT\\nSome of the advantages of IoT include the following:\\n\\nability to access information from anywhere at any time on any device;\\nimproved communication between connected electronic devices;\\ntransferring data packets over a connected network saving time and money; and\\nautomating tasks helping to improve the quality of a business\\'s services and reducing the need for human intervention.\\n\\nSome disadvantages of IoT include the following:\\n\\nAs the number of connected devices increases and more information is shared between devices, the potential that a hacker could steal confidential information also increases.\\nEnterprises may eventually have to deal with massive numbers -- maybe even millions -- of IoT devices, and collecting and managing the data from all those devices will be challenging.\\nIf there\\'s a bug in the system, it\\'s likely that every connected device will become corrupted.\\nSince there\\'s no international standard of compatibility for IoT, it\\'s difficult for devices from different manufacturers to communicate with each other.\\n\\n\\n\\nIoT standards and frameworks\\nThere are several emerging IoT standards, including the following:\\n\\nIPv6\\xc2\\xa0over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) is an open standard defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The 6LoWPAN standard enables any low-power radio to communicate to the internet, including 804.15.4,\\xc2\\xa0Bluetooth Low Energy\\xc2\\xa0(BLE) and\\xc2\\xa0Z-Wave\\xc2\\xa0(for home automation).\\nZigBee is a low-power, low-data rate wireless network used mainly in industrial settings. ZigBee is based on the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.15.4 standard. The ZigBee Alliance created Dotdot, the universal language for IoT that enables smart objects to work securely on any network and understand each other.\\nLiteOS is a Unix-like operating system (OS) for wireless sensor networks. LiteOS supports smartphones,\\xc2\\xa0wearables, intelligent manufacturing applications, smart homes and the internet of vehicles (IoV). The OS also serves as a smart device development platform.\\nOneM2M is a machine-to-machine service layer that can be embedded in software and hardware to connect devices. The global standardization body, OneM2M, was created to develop reusable standards to enable IoT applications across different verticals to communicate.\\nData Distribution Service (DDS) was developed by the Object Management Group (OMG) and is an IoT standard for real-time, scalable and high-performance M2M communication.\\nAdvanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) is an open source published standard for asynchronous messaging by wire. AMQP enables encrypted and interoperable messaging between organizations and applications. The protocol is used in\\xc2\\xa0client-server\\xc2\\xa0messaging and in IoT device management.\\nConstrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a protocol designed by the IETF that specifies how low-power, compute-constrained devices can operate in the internet of things.\\nLong Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) is a protocol for WANs designed to support huge networks, such as smart cities, with millions of low-power devices.\\n\\nIoT frameworks include the following:\\n\\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) IoT is a cloud computing platform for IoT released by Amazon. This framework is designed to enable smart devices to easily connect and securely interact with the AWS cloud and other connected devices.\\nArm Mbed IoT is a platform to develop apps for IoT based on\\xc2\\xa0Arm microcontrollers. The goal of the Arm Mbed IoT platform is to provide a scalable, connected and secure environment for IoT devices by integrating Mbed tools and services.\\nMicrosoft\\'s\\xc2\\xa0Azure\\xc2\\xa0IoT Suite is a platform that consists of a set of services that enables users to interact with and receive data from their IoT devices, as well as perform various operations over data, such as multidimensional analysis, transformation and aggregation, and visualize those operations in a way that\\'s suitable for business.\\nGoogle\\'s Brillo/Weave is a platform for the rapid implementation of IoT applications. The platform consists of two main backbones: Brillo, an Android-based OS for the development of embedded low-power devices, and Weave, an IoT-oriented communication protocol that serves as the communication language between the device and the cloud.\\nCalvin is an open source IoT platform released by Ericsson designed for building and managing distributed applications that enable devices to talk to each other. Calvin includes a development framework for application developers, as well as a runtime environment for handling the running application.\\n\\n\\n\\nConsumer and enterprise IoT applications\\nThere are numerous real-world applications of the internet of things, ranging from consumer IoT and enterprise IoT to manufacturing and industrial IoT (IIoT). IoT applications span numerous verticals, including automotive, telecom and energy.\\nIn the consumer segment, for example,\\xc2\\xa0smart homes\\xc2\\xa0that are equipped with smart thermostats, smart appliances\\xc2\\xa0and\\xc2\\xa0connected heating, lighting and electronic devices can be controlled remotely via computers and smartphones.\\nWearable devices with sensors and software can collect and analyze user data, sending messages to other technologies about\\xc2\\xa0the users\\xc2\\xa0with the aim of making users\\' lives easier and more comfortable. Wearable devices are also used for public safety -- for example, improving first responders\\' response times during emergencies by providing optimized routes to a location or by tracking construction workers\\' or firefighters\\' vital signs at life-threatening sites.\\nIn healthcare, IoT offers many benefits, including the ability to monitor patients more closely using an analysis of the data that\\'s generated. Hospitals often use IoT systems to complete tasks such as inventory management for both pharmaceuticals and medical instruments.\\nSmart\\xc2\\xa0buildings can, for instance, reduce energy costs using sensors that detect how many occupants are in a room. The temperature can adjust automatically -- for example, turning the air conditioner on if sensors detect a conference room is full or turning the heat down if everyone in the office has gone home.\\nIn agriculture, IoT-based\\xc2\\xa0smart farming\\xc2\\xa0systems can help monitor, for instance, light, temperature, humidity and soil moisture of crop fields using connected sensors. IoT is also instrumental in automating irrigation systems.\\nIn a\\xc2\\xa0smart city, IoT sensors and deployments, such as smart streetlights and smart meters, can help alleviate traffic, conserve energy, monitor and address environmental concerns, and improve sanitation.\\n\\n\\nIoT security and privacy issues\\nThe internet of things connects billions of devices to the internet and involves the use of billions of data points, all of which need to be secured. Due to its expanded attack surface,\\xc2\\xa0IoT security\\xc2\\xa0and\\xc2\\xa0IoT privacy\\xc2\\xa0are cited as major concerns.\\nIn 2016, one of the most notorious recent IoT attacks was Mirai, a\\xc2\\xa0botnet\\xc2\\xa0that infiltrated domain name server provider Dyn and took down many websites for an extended period of time in one of the biggest distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks ever seen. Attackers gained access to the network by exploiting poorly secured IoT devices.\\nBecause IoT devices are closely connected, all a hacker has to do is exploit one vulnerability to manipulate all the data, rendering it unusable. Manufacturers that don\\'t update their devices regularly -- or at all -- leave them vulnerable to cybercriminals.\\nAdditionally, connected devices often ask users to input their personal information, including names, ages, addresses, phone numbers and even social media accounts -- information that\\'s invaluable to hackers.\\nHackers aren\\'t the only threat to the internet of things; privacy is another major concern for IoT users. For instance, companies that make and distribute consumer IoT devices could use those devices to obtain and sell users\\' personal data.\\nBeyond leaking personal data, IoT poses a risk to critical infrastructure, including electricity, transportation\\xc2\\xa0and\\xc2\\xa0financial services.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHistory of IoT\\nKevin Ashton, co-founder of the Auto-ID Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), first mentioned the internet of things in a presentation he made to Procter & Gamble (P&G) in 1999. Wanting to bring radio frequency ID (RFID) to the attention of P&G\\'s senior management, Ashton called his presentation \"Internet of Things\" to incorporate the cool new trend of 1999: the internet. MIT professor Neil Gershenfeld\\'s book,\\xc2\\xa0When Things Start to Think, also appeared in 1999. It didn\\'t use the exact term but provided a clear vision of where IoT was headed.\\n\\nIoT has evolved from the convergence of wireless technologies, microelectromechanical systems (MEMSes),\\xc2\\xa0microservices\\xc2\\xa0and the internet. The convergence has helped tear down the silos between operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT), enabling unstructured machine-generated data to be analyzed for insights to drive improvements.\\nAlthough Ashton\\'s was the first mention of the internet of things, the idea of connected devices has been around since the 1970s, under the monikers\\xc2\\xa0embedded internet\\xc2\\xa0and\\xc2\\xa0pervasive computing.\\nThe first internet appliance, for example, was a Coke machine at Carnegie Mellon University in the early 1980s. Using the web, programmers could check the status of the machine and determine whether there would be a cold drink awaiting them, should they decide to make the trip to the machine.\\nIoT evolved from M2M communication, i.e., machines connecting to each other via a network without human interaction. M2M refers to connecting a device to the cloud, managing it and collecting data.\\nTaking M2M to the next level, IoT is a sensor network of billions of smart devices that connect people, systems and other applications to collect and share data. As its foundation, M2M offers the connectivity that enables IoT.\\nThe internet of things is also a natural extension of\\xc2\\xa0supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), a category of\\xc2\\xa0software\\xc2\\xa0application programs for process control, the gathering of data in real time from remote locations to control equipment and conditions. SCADA systems include hardware and software components. The hardware gathers and feeds data into a computer that has SCADA software installed, where it is then processed and presented in a timely manner. The evolution of SCADA is such that late-generation SCADA systems developed into first-generation IoT systems.\\nThe concept of the IoT ecosystem, however, didn\\'t really come into its own until the middle of 2010 when, in part, the government of China said it would make IoT a strategic priority in its five-year plan.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThis was last updated in February 2020\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tContinue Reading About internet of things (IoT)\\r\\n\\t\\t\\n\\nIoT technology for healthcare in 2020\\n\\n\\nIoT security products address threats posed by connected devices\\n\\n\\nMake legacy IoT data protocols part of an IoT strategy\\n\\n\\nOperational IoT must be seen to be secured\\n\\n\\nThe rise of thing commerce and what it means for software development\\n\\n\\nA guide to IoT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRelated Terms\\n\\n\\ndelivery drone\\n\\nA delivery drone is a type of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) used for distributing packages to consumers through advanced AI ... \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSee\\xc2\\xa0complete\\xc2\\xa0definition\\n\\n\\n\\ndrone (UAV)\\n\\nA drone, in technological terms, is an unmanned aircraft.

Your point that IoT has a wide range of applications. But its application\\nin the home and building automation has\\nhelped in making life simpler and more comfortable. The security issues,\\nhowever, cannot be ignored. A good way to tackle security issues is to use devices\\nand products that adhere to security\\nprotocols. Z-Wave, for example, has stronger security standards for devices receiving\\nZ-Wave certification. The encryption standards for transmissions between two\\nnodes are strong. And new pairing is mandatory for each device. A layer of\\nauthentication prevents hackers from gaining control over unsecured devices. \\n\\n\\n\\nAdd My Comment\\nCancel\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xc2\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[-]\\n\\n\\n\\nRameshraju36\\n - 13 Mar 2019 3:34 AM\\n\\nI have done my IoT training in onlineitguru\\xc2\\xa0but where can I found IoT jobs.

A crucial aspect to the extension of this area of application, is the need to enhance the security of data being broadcasted, firstly to protect the privacy of the \"patient\" being monitored, but also to protect that data from risk of manipulation and corruption, with generation of false information which could have deleterious, if not fatal, consequences for any diagnosis stemming from such patient data.\\n\\n\\n\\nAdd My Comment\\nCancel\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xc2\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[-]\\n\\n\\n\\neclaturetechnologies\\n - 24 May 2019 1:47 AM\\n\\nGood to know the about IoT & its benefits over the industries.\\n\\n\\n\\nAdd My Comment\\nCancel\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xc2\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[-]\\n\\n\\n\\nilyasbutt\\n - 29 Jun 2019 7:33 AM\\n\\nThese are very useful notes.\\n\\n\\n\\nAdd My Comment\\nCancel\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xc2\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[-]\\n\\n\\n\\nkrishHegde\\n - 11 Jul 2019 3:04 AM\\n\\nEven if the business makes the Number or not, working with IOT gives kind of pleasure saying that I am with the race of techies.

But what is the Internet of Things? How does it work? And is it really that important?\\n\\nWhat is the Internet of Things?\\nIn a nutshell, the Internet of Things is the concept of connecting any device (so long as it has an on/off switch) to the Internet and to other connected devices. The IoT is a giant network of connected things and people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 all of which collect and share data about the way they are used and about the environment around them.\\nThat includes an extraordinary number of objects of all shapes and sizes \\xe2\\x80\\x93 from smart microwaves, which automatically cook your food for the right length of time, to self-driving cars, whose complex sensors detect objects in their path, to wearable fitness devices that measure your heart rate and the number of steps you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve taken that day, then use that information to suggest exercise plans tailored to you. There are even connected footballs that can track how far and fast they are thrown and record those statistics via an app for future training purposes.\\nHow does it work?\\nDevices and objects with built in sensors are connected to an Internet of Things platform, which integrates data from the different devices and applies analytics to share the most valuable information with applications built to address specific needs.\\nThese powerful IoT platforms can pinpoint exactly what information is useful and what can safely be ignored. This information can be used to detect patterns, make recommendations, and detect possible problems before they occur.\\nFor example, if I own a car manufacturing business, I might want to know which optional components (leather seats or alloy wheels, for example) are the most popular. Using Internet of Things technology, I can:\\n\\nUse sensors to detect which areas in a showroom are the most popular, and where customers linger longest;\\nDrill down into the available sales data to identify which components are selling fastest;\\nAutomatically align sales data with supply, so that popular items don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go out of stock.\\n\\nThe information picked up by connected devices enables me to make smart decisions about which components to stock up on, based on real-time information, which helps me save time and money.\\nWith the insight provided by advanced analytics comes the power to make processes more efficient. Smart objects and systems mean you can automate certain tasks, particularly when these are repetitive, mundane, time-consuming or even dangerous. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s look at some examples to see what this looks like in real life.\\nScenario #1: IoT in your home\\nImagine you wake up at 7am every day to go to work. Your alarm clock does the job of waking you just fine. That is, until something goes wrong. Your train\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cancelled and you have to drive to work instead. The only problem is that it takes longer to drive, and you would have needed to get up at 6.45am to avoid being late. Oh, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pouring with rain, so you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll need to drive slower than usual. A connected or IoT-enabled alarm clock would reset itself based on all these factors, to ensure you got to work on time. It could recognize that your usual train is cancelled, calculate the driving distance and travel time for your alternative route to work, check the weather and factor in slower travelling speed because of heavy rain, and calculate when it needs to wake you up so you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not late. If it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super-smart, if might even sync with your IoT-enabled coffee maker, to ensure your morning caffeine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ready to go when you get up.\\nScenario #2: IoT in transport\\nHaving been woken by your smart alarm, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re now driving to work. On comes the engine light. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99d rather not head straight to the garage, but what if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something urgent? In a connected car, the sensor that triggered the check engine light would communicate with others in the car. A component called the diagnostic bus collects data from these sensors and passes it to a gateway in the car, which sends the most relevant information to the manufacturer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s platform. The manufacturer can use data from the car to offer you an appointment to get the part fixed, send you directions to the nearest dealer, and make sure the correct replacement part is ordered so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ready for you when you show up.\\nFind out more\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got lots of examples that show the Internet of Things in action. Check out Olli, the self-driving car, or Candy, the cognitive sweet dispenser that will only dish out the sugar when you ask nicely. Got questions? We\\xe2\\x80\\x99d love to hear them!

Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions, and every time a new transaction occurs on the blockchain, a record of that transaction is added to every participant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ledger. The decentralised database managed by multiple participants is known as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).\\nBlockchain is a type of DLT in which transactions are recorded with an immutable cryptographic signature called a hash.\\n\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\nThis means if one block in one chain was changed, it would be immediately apparent it had been tampered with. If hackers wanted to corrupt a blockchain system, they would have to change every block in the chain, across all of the distributed versions of the chain. \\nBlockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are constantly and continually growing as blocks are being added to the chain, which significantly adds to the security of the ledger.\\n\\xc2\\xa0 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy is there so much hype around blockchain technology?\\nThere have been many attempts to create digital money in the past, but they have always failed.\\nThe prevailing issue is trust. If someone creates a new currency called the X dollar, how can we trust that they won't give themselves a million X dollars, or steal your X dollars for themselves?\\nBitcoin was designed to solve this problem by using a specific type of database called a blockchain. Most normal databases, such as an SQL database, have someone in charge who can change the entries (e.g. giving themselves a million X dollars).

But since then, it has evolved into something greater, and the main question every single person is asking is: What is Blockchain?Is Blockchain Technology the New Internet?What exactly is Blockchain?A blockchain\\xc2\\xa0carries no transaction cost.How Does a Blockchain Work?The Three Pillars of Blockchain TechnologyMaintaining the Blockchain \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Network, and NodesWhy do people use the peer-to-peer network?The use of networks and nodes in cryptocurrencies.Who Will Use The Blockchain?What is Blockchain good for?Is Blockchain Technology the New Internet?By allowing digital information to be distributed but not copied, blockchain technology created the backbone of a new type of internet. Originally devised for the digital currency, Bitcoin blockchain, (Buy Bitcoin) the tech community has now found other potential uses for the technology.In this guide, we are going to explain to you what the blockchain technology is, and what its properties are what make it so unique. So, we hope you enjoy this, What Is Blockchain Guide. And if you already know what blockchain is and want to become a blockchain developer please check out our in-depth blockchain tutorial and create your very first blockchain.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xc2\\xa0A blockchain is, in the simplest of terms, a time-stamped series of immutable records of data that is managed by a cluster of computers not owned by any single entity. Each of these blocks of data (i.e. block) is secured and bound to each other using cryptographic principles (i.e. chain).So, what is so special about it and why are we saying that it has industry-disrupting capabilities?The blockchain network has no central authority \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it is the very definition of a democratized system. Since it is a shared and immutable ledger, the information in it is open for anyone and everyone to see. Hence, anything that is built on the blockchain is by its very nature transparent and everyone involved is accountable for their actions.What exactly is Blockchain?A blockchain\\xc2\\xa0carries no transaction cost.(An infrastructure cost yes, but no transaction cost.) The blockchain is a simple yet ingenious way of passing information from A to B in a fully automated and safe manner. One party to a transaction initiates the process by creating a block. This block is verified by thousands, perhaps millions of computers distributed around the net. The verified block is added to a chain, which is stored across the net, creating not just a unique record, but a unique record with a unique history. Falsifying a single record would mean falsifying the entire chain in millions of instances. That is virtually impossible. Bitcoin uses this model for monetary transactions, but it can be deployed in many other ways.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThink of a railway company. We buy tickets on an app or the web. The credit card company takes a cut for processing the transaction. Blockchains, not only can the railway operator save on credit card processing fees, it can move the entire ticketing process to the blockchain. The two parties in the transaction are the railway company and the passenger. The ticket is a block, which will be added to a ticket blockchain. Just as a monetary transaction on the blockchain is a unique, independently verifiable and unfalsifiable record (like Bitcoin), so can your ticket be. Incidentally, the final ticket blockchain is also a record of all transactions for, say, a certain train route, or even the entire train network, comprising every ticket ever sold, every journey ever taken.But the key here is this: it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s free. Not only can the blockchain transfer and store money, but it can also replace all processes and business models that rely on charging a small fee for a transaction. Or any other transaction between two parties. Blockchain Technology incurs both transaction cost and infrastructure cost True False Correct! Wrong!Here is another example. The gig economy hub Fivver charges 0.5 dollars on a 5 transaction between individuals buying and selling services. Using blockchain the transaction is free. Ergo, Fivver will cease to exist. So will auction houses and any other business entity based on the market-maker principle.Even recent entrants like Uber and Airbnb are threatened by blockchain. All you need to do is encode the transactional information for a car ride or an overnight stay, and again you have a perfectly safe way that disrupts the business model of the companies which have just begun to challenge the traditional economy. We are not just cutting out the fee-processing middle man, we are also eliminating the need for the match-making platform.Because blockchain transactions are free, you can charge minuscule amounts, say 1/100 of a cent for a video view or article read. Why should I pay The Economist or National Geographic an annual subscription fee if I can pay per article on Facebook or my favorite chat app? Again, remember that blockchain transactions carry no transaction cost. You can charge for anything in any amount without worrying about third parties cutting into your profits.Blockchain may make selling recorded music profitable again for artists by cutting out music companies and distributors like Apple or Spotify. The music you buy could even be encoded in the blockchain itself, making it a cloud archive for any song purchased. Because the amounts charged can be so small, subscription and streaming services will become irrelevant.It goes further. Ebooks could be fitted with blockchain code. Instead of Amazon taking a cut, and the credit card company earning money on the sale, the books would circulate in encoded form and a successful blockchain transaction would transfer money to the author and unlock the book. Transfer ALL the money to the author, not just meager royalties. You could do this on a book review website like Goodreads, or on your own website. The marketplace Amazon is then unnecessary. Successful iterations could even include reviews and other third-party information about the book.In the financial world the applications are more obvious and the revolutionary changes more imminent. Blockchains will change the way stock exchanges work, loans are bundled, and insurances contracted. They will eliminate bank accounts and practically all services offered by banks. Almost every financial institution will go bankrupt or be forced to change fundamentally, once the advantages of a safe ledger technology without transaction fees are widely understood and implemented. After all, the financial system is built on taking a small cut of your money for the privilege of facilitating a transaction. Bankers will become mere advisers, not gatekeepers of money. Stockbrokers will no longer be able to earn commissions and the buy/sell spread will disappear.How Does a Blockchain Work?Picture a spreadsheet that is duplicated thousands of times across a network of computers. Then imagine that this network is designed to regularly update this spreadsheet and you have a basic understanding of the blockchain.Information held on a blockchain exists as a shared \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and continually reconciled \\xe2\\x80\\x94 database. This is a way of using the network that has obvious benefits. The blockchain database isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stored in any single location, meaning the records it keeps are truly public and easily verifiable. No centralized version of this information exists for a hacker to corrupt. Hosted by millions of computers simultaneously, its data is accessible to anyone on the internet.To go in deeper with the Google spreadsheet analogy, I would like you to read this piece from a blockchain specialist.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe traditional way of sharing documents with collaboration is to send a Microsoft Word document to another recipient and ask them to make revisions to it. The problem with that scenario is that you need to wait until receiving a return copy before you can see or make other changes because you are locked out of editing it until the other person is done with it. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how databases work today. Two owners can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be messing with the same record at once. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how banks maintain money balances and transfers; they briefly lock access (or decrease the balance) while they make a transfer, then update the other side, then re-open access (or update again). With Google Docs (or Google Sheets), both parties have access to the same document at the same time, and the single version of that document is always visible to both of them. It is like a shared ledger, but it is a shared document. The distributed part comes into play when sharing involves a number of people.Imagine the number of legal documents that should be used that way. Instead of passing them to each other, losing track of versions, and not being in sync with the other version, why can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t *all* business documents become shared instead of transferred back and forth? So many types of legal contracts would be ideal for that kind of workflow. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need a blockchain to share documents, but the shared documents analogy is a powerful one.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 William Mougayar, Venture advisor, 4x entrepreneur, marketer, strategist, and blockchain specialist The reason why the blockchain has gained so much admiration is that:It is not owned by a single entity, hence it is decentralizedThe data is cryptographically stored insideThe blockchain is immutable, so no one can tamper with the data that is inside the blockchainThe blockchain is transparent so one can track the data if they want toThe Three Pillars of Blockchain TechnologyThe three main properties of Blockchain Technology which have helped it gain widespread acclaim are as follows:DecentralizationTransparencyImmutabilityPillar #1: DecentralizationBefore Bitcoin and BitTorrent came along, we were more used to centralized services. The idea is very simple. You have a centralized entity that stored all the data and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have to interact solely with this entity to get whatever information you required.Another example of a centralized system is the banks. They store all your money, and the only way that you can pay someone is by going through the bank.The traditional client-server model is a perfect example of this:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen you google search for something, you send a query to the server who then gets back at you with the relevant information. That is a simple client-server.Now, centralized systems have treated us well for many years, however, they have several vulnerabilities.Firstly, because they are centralized, all the data is stored in one spot. This makes them easy target spots for potential hackers.If the centralized system were to go through a software upgrade, it would halt the entire systemWhat if the centralized entity somehow shuts down for whatever reason? That way nobody will be able to access the information that it possessesWorst case scenario, what if this entity gets corrupted and malicious? If that happens then all the data that is inside the blockchain will be compromised.So, what happens if we just take this centralized entity away?In a decentralized system, the information is not stored by one single entity. In fact, everyone in the network owns the information.In a decentralized network, if you wanted to interact with your friend then you can do so directly without going through a third party. That was the main ideology behind Bitcoins. You and only you alone are in charge of your money. You can send your money to anyone you want without having to go through a bank.\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPillar #2: TransparencyOne of the most interesting and misunderstood concepts in blockchain\\xc2\\xa0 is \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctransparency.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Some people say that blockchain gives you privacy while some say that it is transparent. Why do you think that happens?Well\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 a person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s identity is hidden via complex cryptography and represented only by their public address. So, if you were to look up a person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s transaction history, you will not see \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBob sent 1 BTC\\xe2\\x80\\x9d instead you will see \\xe2\\x80\\x9c1MF1bhsFLkBzzz9vpFYEmvwT2TbyCt7NZJ sent 1 BTC\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.The following snapshot of Ethereum transactions will show you what we mean:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo, while the person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s real identity is secure, you will still see all the transactions that were done by their public address. This level of transparency has never existed before within a financial system. It adds that extra, and much needed, level of accountability which is required by some of these biggest institutions.Speaking purely from the point of view of cryptocurrency, if you know the public address of one of these big companies, you can simply pop it in an explorer and look at all the transactions that they have engaged in. This forces them to be honest, something that they have never had to deal with before.However, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not the best use-case. We are pretty sure that most of these companies won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t transact using cryptocurrency, and even if they do, they won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do ALL their transactions using cryptocurrency. However, what if the blockchain was integrated\\xe2\\x80\\xa6say in their supply chain?You can see why something like this can be very helpful for the finance industry right?Pillar #3: ImmutabilityImmutability, in the context of the blockchain, means that once something has been entered into the blockchain, it cannot be tampered with.Can you imagine how valuable this will be for financial institutes?Imagine how many embezzlement cases can be nipped in the bud if people know that they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwork the books\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and fiddle around with company accounts.The reason why the blockchain gets this property is that of the cryptographic hash function.In simple terms, hashing means taking an input string of any length and giving out an output of a fixed length. In the context of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, the transactions are taken as input and run through a hashing algorithm (Bitcoin uses SHA-256) which gives an output of a fixed length.Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s see how the hashing process works. We are going to put in certain inputs. For this exercise, we are going to use the SHA-256 (Secure Hashing Algorithm 256).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs you can see, in the case of SHA-256, no matter how big or small your input is, the output will always have a fixed 256-bits length. This becomes critical when you are dealing with a huge amount of data and transactions. So basically, instead of remembering the input data which could be huge, you can just remember the hash and keep track.A cryptographic hash function is a special class of hash functions that has various properties making it ideal for cryptography. There are certain properties that a cryptographic hash function needs to have in order to be considered secure. You can read about those in detail in our guide on hashing.There is just one property that we want you to focus on today. It is called the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAvalanche Effect.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dWhat does that mean?Even if you make a small change in your input, the changes that will be reflected in the hash will be huge. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s test it out using SHA-256:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDo you see that? Even though you just changed the case of the first alphabet of the input, look at how much that has affected the output hash. Now, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go back to our previous point when we were looking at blockchain architecture. What we said was:The blockchain is a linked list that contains data and a hash pointer that points to its previous block, hence creating the chain. What is a hash pointer? A hash pointer is similar to a pointer, but instead of just containing the address of the previous block it also contains the hash of the data inside the previous block.This one small tweak is what makes blockchains so amazingly reliable and trailblazing.Imagine this for a second, a hacker attacks block 3 and tries to change the data. Because of the properties of hash functions, a slight change in data will change the hash drastically. This means that any slight changes made in block 3, will change the hash which is stored in block 2, now that in turn will change the data and the hash of block 2 which will result in changes in block 1 and so on and so forth. This will completely change the chain, which is impossible. This is exactly how blockchains attain immutability. Which of the following is NOT a pillar of blockchain technology: Transparency Decentralization KYC Immutability Correct! Wrong!Maintaining the Blockchain \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Network, and NodesThe blockchain is maintained by a peer-to-peer network. The network is a collection of nodes that are interconnected to one another. Nodes are individual computers that take in input and performs a function on them and gives an output. The blockchain uses a special kind of network called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpeer-to-peer network\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which partitions its entire workload between participants, who are all equally privileged, called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpeers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. There is no longer one central server, now there are several distributed and decentralized peers.Why do people use the peer-to-peer network?One of the main uses of the peer-to-peer network is file sharing, also called torrenting. If you are to use a client-server model for downloading, then it is usually extremely slow and entirely dependent on the health of the server. Plus, as we said, it is prone to censorship.However, in a peer-to-peer system, there is no central authority, and hence if even one of the peers in the network goes out of the race, you still have more peers to download from. Plus, it is not subject to the idealistic standards of a central system, hence it is not prone to censorship.If we were to compare the two:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImage courtesy: QuoraThe decentralized nature of a peer-to-peer system becomes critical as we move on to the next section. How critical? Well, the simple (at least on paper) idea of combining this peer-to-peer network with a payment system has completely revolutionized the finance industry by giving birth to cryptocurrency.The use of networks and nodes in cryptocurrencies.The peer-to-peer network structure in cryptocurrency is structured according to the consensus mechanism that they are utilizing. For cryptocurrency like Bitcoin and Ethereum which uses a normal proof-of-work consensus mechanism (Ethereum will eventually move on to Proof of Stake), all the nodes have the same privilege. The idea is to create an egalitarian network. The nodes are not given any special privileges, however, their functions and degree of participation may differ. There is no centralized server/entity, nor is there any hierarchy. It is a flat topology.These decentralized cryptocurrencies are structured like that is because of a simple reason, to stay true to their philosophy. The idea is to have a currency system, where everyone is treated as an equal and there is no governing body, which can determine the value of the currency based on a whim. This is true for both bitcoin and Ethereum.Now, if there is no central system, how would everyone in the system get to know that a certain transaction has happened? The network follows the gossip protocol. Think of how gossip spreads. Suppose Alice sent 3 ETH to Bob. The nodes nearest to her will get to know of this, and then they will tell the nodes closest to them, and then they will tell their neighbors, and this will keep on spreading out until everyone knows. Nodes are basically your nosy, annoying relatives.So, what is a node in the context of Ethereum? A node is simply a computer that participates in the Ethereum network. This participation can be in three ways:By keeping a shallow-copy of the blockchain aka a Light ClientBy keeping a full copy of the blockchain aka a Full NodeBy verifying the transactions aka MiningHowever, the problem with this design is that it is not really that scalable. Which is why a lot of new generation cryptocurrencies adopt a leader-based consensus mechanism. In EOS, Cardano, Neo, etc. the nodes elect leader nodes or \\xe2\\x80\\x9csupernodes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d who are in charge of the consensus and overall network health. These cryptos are a lot faster but they are not the most decentralized of systems. Participation of a node can be in the following ways: By storing private keys for users By verifying the identity of the users  By keeping track other nodes that are bad By validating transactions through mining Correct! Wrong!So, in a way, cryptos have to make the trade-off between speed and decentralization.Who Will Use The Blockchain?As a web infrastructure, you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to know about the blockchain for it to be useful in your life.Currently, finance offers the strongest use cases for the technology. International remittances, for instance. The World Bank estimates that over $430 billion US in money transfers were sent in 2015. And at the moment there is a high demand for blockchain developers.The blockchain potentially cuts out the middleman for these types of transactions. Personal computing became accessible to the general public with the invention of the Graphical User Interface (GUI), which took the form of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdesktop\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Similarly, the most common GUI devised for the blockchain are the so-called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwallet\\xe2\\x80\\x9d applications, which people use to buy things with Bitcoin, and store it along with other cryptocurrencies.Transactions online are closely connected to the processes of identity verification. It is easy to imagine that wallet apps will transform in the coming years to include other types of identity management.What is Blockchain good for?The blockchain network gives internet users the ability to create value and authenticates digital information. What new business applications will result from this?#1 Smart contractsDistributed ledger technology enable the coding of simple contracts that will execute when specified conditions are met. Ethereum is an open-source blockchain project that was built specifically to realize this possibility. Still, in its early stages, Ethereum has the potential to leverage the usefulness of blockchains on a truly world-changing scale. With the presence of blockchain between two parties agreeing on a contract: The contract loses credibility There is no longer a need for a middleman The cost can become extremely high The contract edited by a third-party Correct! Wrong!At the technology\\xe2\\x80\\x99s current level of development, smart contracts can be programmed to perform simple functions. For instance, a derivative could be paid out when a financial instrument meets a certain benchmark, with the use of blockchain technology and Bitcoin enabling the payout to be automated.#2 The sharing economyWith companies like Uber and Airbnb flourishing, the sharing economy is already a proven success. Currently, however, users who want to hail a ride-sharing service have to rely on an intermediary like Uber. By enabling peer-to-peer payments, the blockchain opens the door to direct interaction between parties \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a truly decentralized sharing economy results.An early example, OpenBazaar uses the blockchain to create a peer-to-peer eBay. Download the app onto your computing device, and you can transact with OpenBazzar vendors without paying transaction fees. The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno rules\\xe2\\x80\\x9d ethos of the protocol means that personal reputation will be even more important to business interactions than it currently is on eBay.#3 CrowdfundingCrowdfunding initiatives like Kickstarter and Gofundme are doing the advance work for the emerging peer-to-peer economy. The popularity of these sites suggests people want to have a direct say in product development. Blockchains take this interest to the next level, potentially creating crowd-sourced venture capital funds.In 2016, one such experiment, the Ethereum-based DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), raised an astonishing $200 million USD in just over two months. Participants purchased \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDAO tokens\\xe2\\x80\\x9d allowing them to vote on smart contract venture capital investments (voting power was proportionate to the number of DAO they were holding). A subsequent hack of project funds proved that the project was launched without proper due diligence, with disastrous consequences. Regardless, the DAO experiment suggests the blockchain has the potential to usher in \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca new paradigm of economic cooperation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d#4 GovernanceBy making the results fully transparent and publicly accessible, distributed database technology could bring full transparency to elections or any other kind of poll taking. Ethereum-based smart contracts help to automate the process.The app, Boardroom, enables organizational decision-making to happen on the blockchain. In practice, this means company governance becomes fully transparent and verifiable when managing digital assets, equity or information.#5 Supply chain auditingConsumers increasingly want to know that the ethical claims companies make about their products are real. Distributed ledgers provide an easy way to certify that the backstories of the things we buy are genuine. Transparency comes with blockchain-based timestamping of a date and location \\xe2\\x80\\x94 on ethical diamonds, for instance \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that corresponds to a product number.The UK-based Provenance offers supply chain auditing for a range of consumer goods. Making use of the Ethereum blockchain, a Provenance pilot project ensures that fish sold in Sushi restaurants in Japan have been sustainably harvested by its suppliers in Indonesia.#6 File storageDecentralizing file storage on the internet brings clear benefits. Distributing data throughout the network protects files from getting hacked or lost.InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) makes it easy to conceptualize how a distributed web might operate. Similar to the way a BitTorrent moves data around the internet, IPFS gets rid of the need for centralized client-server relationships (i.e., the current web). An internet made up of completely decentralized websites has the potential to speed up file transfer and streaming times. Such an improvement is not only convenient. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a necessary upgrade to the web\\xe2\\x80\\x99s currently overloaded content-delivery systems.#7 Prediction marketsThe crowdsourcing of predictions on event probability is proven to have a high degree of accuracy. Averaging opinions cancels out the unexamined biases that distort judgment. Prediction markets that payout according to event outcomes are already active. Blockchains are a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwisdom of the crowd\\xe2\\x80\\x9d technology that will no doubt find other applications in the years to come.The prediction market application Augur makes share offerings on the outcome of real-world events. Participants can earn money by buying into the correct prediction. The more shares purchased in the correct outcome, the higher the payout will be. With a small commitment of funds (less than a dollar), anyone can ask a question, create a market based on a predicted outcome, and collect half of all transaction fees the market generates.#8 Protection of intellectual propertyAs is well known, digital information can be infinitely reproduced \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and distributed widely thanks to the internet. This has given web users globally a goldmine of free content. However, copyright holders have not been so lucky, losing control over their intellectual property and suffering financially as a consequence. Smart contracts can protect copyright and automate the sale of creative works online, eliminating the risk of file copying and redistribution.Mycelia uses the blockchain to create a peer-to-peer music distribution system. Founded by the UK singer-songwriter Imogen Heap, Mycelia enables musicians to sell songs directly to audiences, as well as license samples to producers and divvy up royalties to songwriters and musicians \\xe2\\x80\\x94 all of these functions being automated by smart contracts. The capacity of blockchains to issue payments in fractional cryptocurrency amounts (micropayments) suggests this use case for the blockchain has a strong chance of success.#9 Internet of Things (IoT)What is the IoT? The network-controlled management of certain types of electronic devices \\xe2\\x80\\x94 for instance, the monitoring of air temperature in a storage facility. Smart contracts make the automation of remote systems management possible. A combination of software, sensors, and the network facilitates an exchange of data between objects and mechanisms. The result increases system efficiency and improves cost monitoring.The biggest players in manufacturing, tech, and telecommunications are all vying for IoT dominance. Think Samsung, IBM, and AT&T. A natural extension of existing infrastructure controlled by incumbents, IoT applications will run the gamut from predictive maintenance of mechanical parts to data analytics, and mass-scale automated systems management.#10 Neighbourhood MicrogridsBlockchain technologies enables the buying and selling of the renewable energy generated by neighborhood microgrids. When solar panels make excess energy, Ethereum-based smart contracts automatically redistribute it. Similar types of smart contract automation will have many other applications as the IoT becomes a reality.Located in Brooklyn, Consensys is one of the foremost companies globally that is developing a range of applications for Ethereum. One project they are partnering on is Transactive Grid, working with the distributed energy outfit, LO3. A prototype project currently up and running uses Ethereum smart contracts to automate the monitoring and redistribution of microgrid energy. This so-called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cintelligent grid\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is an early example of IoT functionality.#11 Identity managementThere is a definite need for better identity management on the web. The ability to verify your identity is the lynchpin of financial transactions that happen online. However, remedies for the security risks that come with web commerce are imperfect at best. Distributed ledgers offer enhanced methods for proving who you are, along with the possibility to digitize personal documents. Having a secure identity will also be important for online interactions \\xe2\\x80\\x94 for instance, in the sharing economy. A good reputation, after all, is the most important condition for conducting transactions online.Developing digital identity standards is proving to be a highly complex process. Technical challenges aside, a universal online identity solution requires cooperation between private entities and the government. Add to that the need to navigate legal systems in different countries and the problem becomes exponentially difficult. An E-Commerce on the internet currently relies on the SSL certificate (the little green lock) for secure transactions on the web. Netki is a startup that aspires to create an SSL standard for the blockchain. Having recently announced a $3.5 million seed round, Netki expects a product launch in early 2017.#12 AML and KYCAnti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) practices have a strong potential for being adapted to the blockchain. Currently, financial institutions must perform a labor-intensive multi-step process for each new customer. KYC costs could be reduced through cross-institution client verification and at the same time increase monitoring and analysis effectiveness.Startup Polycoin has an AML/KYC solution that involves analyzing transactions. Those transactions identified as being suspicious are forwarded on to compliance officers. Another startup, Tradle is developing an application called Trust in Motion (TiM). Characterized as an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInstagram for KYC\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, TiM allows customers to take a snapshot of key documents (passport, utility bill, etc.). Once verified by the bank, this data is cryptographically stored on the blockchain.#13 Data managementToday, in exchange for their personal data people can use social media platforms like Facebook for free. In future, users will have the ability to manage and sell the data their online activity generates. Because it can be easily distributed in small fractional amounts, Bitcoin \\xe2\\x80\\x94 or something like it \\xe2\\x80\\x94 will most likely be the currency that gets used for this type of transaction.The MIT project Enigma understands that user privacy is the key precondition for creating of a personal data marketplace. Enigma uses cryptographic techniques to allow individual data sets to be split between nodes and at the same time run bulk computations over the data group as a whole. Fragmenting the data also makes Enigma scalable (unlike those blockchain solutions where data gets replicated on every node). A Beta launch is promised within the next six months.#14 Land title registrationAs Publicly-accessible ledgers, blockchains can make all kinds of record-keeping more efficient. Property titles are a case in point. They tend to be susceptible to fraud, as well as costly and labor-intensive to administer.A number of countries are undertaking blockchain-based land registry projects. Honduras was the first government to announce such an initiative in 2015, although the current status of that project is unclear. This year, the Republic of Georgia cemented a deal with the Bitfury Group to develop a blockchain system for property titles. Reportedly, Hernando de Soto, the high-profile economist, and property rights advocate will be advising on the project. Most recently, Sweden announced it was experimenting with a blockchain application for property titles.#15 Stock tradingThe potential for added efficiency in share settlement makes a strong use case for blockchains in stock trading. When executed peer-to-peer, trade confirmations become almost instantaneous (as opposed to taking three days for clearance). Potentially, this means intermediaries \\xe2\\x80\\x94 such as the clearing house, auditors and custodians \\xe2\\x80\\x94 get removed from the process.Numerous stock and commodities exchanges are prototyping blockchain applications for the services they offer, including the ASX (Australian Securities Exchange), the Deutsche B\\xc3\\xb6rse (Frankfurt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stock exchange) and the JPX (Japan Exchange Group). Most high profile because the acknowledged first mover in the area, is the Nasdaq\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Linq, a platform for private market trading (typically between pre-IPO startups and investors). A partnership with the blockchain tech company Chain, Linq announced the completion of it its first share trade in 2015. More recently, Nasdaq announced the development of a trial blockchain project for proxy voting on the Estonian Stock Market.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xc2\\xa0Like what you read?

vast number of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthings\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that are connected to the internet so they can share data with other things \\xe2\\x80\\x93 IoT applications, connected devices, industrial machines and more. Internet-connected devices use built-in sensors to collect data and, in some cases, act on it. IoT connected devices and machines can improve how we work and live. Real-world Internet of Things examples range from a smart home that automatically adjusts heating and lighting to a smart factory that monitors industrial machines to look for problems, then automatically adjusts to avoid failures.\\n\\n\\nHistory\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0Today's World\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0Who Uses It\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0How It Works\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0Next Steps\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHistory of the Internet of Things\\nThe term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInternet of Things\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was coined by entrepreneur Kevin Ashton, one of the founders of the Auto-ID Center at MIT. Ashton was part of a team that discovered how to link objects to the internet through an RFID tag. He first used the phrase \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInternet of Things\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in a 1999 presentation \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and it has stuck around ever since.\\nAshton may have been first to use the term Internet of Things, but the concept of connected devices \\xe2\\x80\\x93 particularly connected machines \\xe2\\x80\\x93 has been around for a long time. For example, machines have been communicating with each other since the first electric telegraphs were developed in the late 1830s. Other technologies that fed into IoT were radio voice transmissions, wireless (Wi-Fi) technologies and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) software. Then in 1982, a modified Coke machine at Carnegie Mellon University became the first connected smart appliance. Using the university\\xe2\\x80\\x99s local ethernet or ARPANET \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a precursor to today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s internet \\xe2\\x80\\x93 students could find out which drinks were stocked, and whether they were cold.\\nToday, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re living in a world where there are more IoT connected devices than humans. These IoT connected devices and machines range from wearables like smartwatches to RFID inventory tracking chips. IoT connected devices communicate via networks or cloud-based platforms connected to the Internet of Things. The real-time insights gleaned from this IoT collected data fuel digital transformation. The Internet of Things promises many positive changes for health and safety, business operations, industrial performance, and global environmental and humanitarian issues.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReducing Downtime So Truckers Can Keep on Trucking\\nBy collecting streaming IoT data in real time from thousands of sensors on each vehicle, Volvo Trucks can monitor fault codes to know when anything is amiss with a major system, like the engine or transmission.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Internet of Things in Today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s World\\nThe Internet of Things has had significant effects on our world.

Retailers capture IoT data from in-store and digital channels and apply analytics (including artificial intelligence, or AI) for real-time, contextual listening and to understand behavior patterns and preferences. They often use IoT connected devices like RFID inventory tracking chips, cellular and Wi-Fi systems, beacons and smart shelves in their Internet of Things strategy.\\n\\n\\nMore retail solutions\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nManufacturing\\nIoT connects all phases of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) process \\xe2\\x80\\x93 from supply chain to delivery \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for a cohesive view of production, process and product data. Advanced IoT sensors in factory machines or warehouse shelves, along with big data analytics and predictive modeling, can prevent defects and downtime, maximize equipment performance, cut warranty costs, boost production yield and enhance the customer experience.\\n\\n\\nMore manufacturing solutions\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHealth Care\\nIoT technology captures data streaming in real time from the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) \\xe2\\x80\\x93 such as wearables and other medical connected devices that monitor exercise, sleep and other health habits. This IoT data enables precise diagnoses and treatment plans, improves patient safety and outcomes, and streamlines care delivery. \\n\\n\\nMore health care solutions\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTransportation and Logistics\\nIoT with geofence-enabled location intelligence and AI, deployed across the value chain, can deliver greater efficiency and reliability for transportation and logistics companies. This technology can improve service quality, reduce downtime and boost customer satisfaction. It can also enhance safety and reduce costs by managing, tracking and monitoring connected vehicles, freight and other mobile assets in real time.\\n\\n\\nMore transportation and logistics solutions\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGovernment\\nIoT applications are used to address many real-world issues \\xe2\\x80\\x93 traffic congestion, city services, economic development, citizen engagement, and public safety and security.

Unlike humans, these systems can only learn or be taught how to do specific tasks, which is why they are called narrow AI.What can narrow AI do?There are a vast number of emerging applications for narrow AI: interpreting video feeds from drones carrying out visual inspections of infrastructure such as oil pipelines, organizing personal and business calendars, responding to simple customer-service queries, co-ordinating with other intelligent systems to carry out tasks like booking a hotel at a suitable time and location, helping  \\tradiologists to spot potential tumors in X-rays, flagging inappropriate content online, detecting wear and tear in elevators from data gathered by IoT devices, the list goes on and on.What can general AI do?Artificial general intelligence is very different, and is the type of adaptable intellect found in humans, a flexible form of intelligence capable of learning how to carry out vastly different tasks, anything from haircutting to building spreadsheets, or to reason about a wide variety of topics based on its accumulated experience. This is the sort of AI more commonly seen in movies, the likes of HAL in  \\t2001 or Skynet in The Terminator, but which doesn\\'t exist today and AI experts are fiercely divided over how soon it will become a reality.Special report: How to implement AI and machine learning (free PDF)A survey conducted among four groups of experts in 2012/13 by AI researchers Vincent C M\\xc3\\xbcller and philosopher Nick Bostrom reported a 50 percent chance that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) would be developed between 2040 and 2050, rising to 90 percent by 2075. The group went even further, predicting that so-called \\' \\tsuperintelligence\\' -- which Bostrom defines as \"any intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest\" -- was expected some 30 years after the achievement of AGI.That said, some AI experts believe such projections are wildly optimistic given our limited understanding of the human brain, and believe that AGI is still centuries away.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                        Artificial intelligence: How to build the business case\\n                    \\n\\nAI might be a hot topic but you\\'ll still need to justify those projects.\\n\\nRead More\\n\\n\\nWhat is machine learning?There is a broad body of research in AI, much of which feeds into and complements each other.Currently enjoying something of a resurgence, machine learning is where a computer system is fed large amounts of data, which it then uses to learn how to carry out a specific task, such as understanding speech or captioning a photograph.What are neural networks?Key to the process of machine learning are neural networks. These are brain-inspired networks of interconnected layers of algorithms, called neurons, that feed data into each other, and which can be trained to carry out specific tasks by modifying the importance attributed to input data as it passes between the layers. During training of these neural networks, the weights attached to different inputs will continue to be varied until the output from the neural network is very close to what is desired, at which point the network will have \\'learned\\' how to carry out a particular task.A subset of machine learning is deep learning, where neural networks are expanded into sprawling networks with a huge number of layers that are trained using massive amounts of data. It is these deep neural networks that have fuelled the current leap forward in the ability of computers to carry out task like speech recognition and computer vision.Download now: IT leader\\'s guide to deep learning\\xc2\\xa0(Tech Pro Research)There are various types of neural networks, with different strengths and weaknesses. Recurrent neural networks are a type of neural net particularly well suited to language processing and speech recognition, while convolutional neural networks are more commonly used in image recognition. The design of neural networks is also evolving, with researchers recently  \\trefining a more effective form of deep neural network called long short-term memory or LSTM, allowing it to operate fast enough to be used in on-demand systems like Google Translate.The structure and training of deep neural networks. \\n                                                    Image: Nuance\\n                                                Another area of AI research is evolutionary computation, which borrows from Darwin\\'s theory of natural selection, and sees genetic algorithms undergo random mutations and combinations between generations in an attempt to evolve the optimal solution to a given problem. This approach has even been used to help design AI models, effectively using AI to help build AI. This use of evolutionary algorithms to optimize neural networks is called neuroevolution, and could have an important role to play in helping design efficient AI as the use of intelligent systems becomes more prevalent, particularly as demand for data scientists often outstrips supply. The technique was recently showcased by Uber AI Labs, which released papers on using genetic algorithms to train deep neural networks for reinforcement learning problems.Finally there are expert systems, where computers are programmed with rules that allow them to take a series of decisions based on a large number of inputs, allowing that machine to mimic the behaviour of a human expert in a specific domain. An example of these knowledge-based systems might be, for example, an autopilot system flying a plane.What is fueling the resurgence in AI?The biggest breakthroughs for AI research in recent years have been in the field of machine learning, in particular within the field of deep learning.This has been driven in part by the easy availability of data, but even more so by an explosion in parallel computing power in recent years, during which time the use of GPU clusters to train machine-learning systems has become more prevalent. Not only do these clusters offer vastly more powerful systems for training machine-learning models, but they are now widely available as cloud services over the internet. Over time the major tech firms, the likes of Google and Microsoft, have moved to using specialised chips tailored to both running, and more recently training, machine-learning models. An example of one of these custom chips is Google\\'s Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), the latest version of which accelerates the rate at which useful machine-learning models built using Google\\'s TensorFlow software library can infer information from data, as well as the rate at which they can be trained. These chips are not just used to train up models for DeepMind and Google Brain, but also the models that underpin Google Translate and the image recognition in Google Photo, as well as services that allow the public to build machine learning models using  Google\\'s TensorFlow Research Cloud. The second generation of these chips was unveiled at Google\\'s I/O conference in May last year, with an array of these new TPUs able to train a Google machine-learning model used for translation in half the time it would take an array of the top-end graphics processing units (GPUs).What are the elements of machine learning?As mentioned, machine learning is a subset of AI and is generally split into two main categories: supervised and unsupervised learning.Supervised learningA common technique for teaching AI systems is by training them using a very large number of labelled examples. These machine-learning systems are fed huge amounts of data, which has been annotated to highlight the features of interest. These might be photos labelled to indicate whether they contain a dog or written sentences that have footnotes to indicate whether the word \\'bass\\' relates to music or a fish. Once trained, the system can then apply these labels can to new data, for example to a dog in a photo that\\'s just been uploaded.This process of teaching a machine by example is called supervised learning and the role of labelling these examples is commonly carried out by  online workers, employed through platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk.See also: How artificial intelligence is taking call centers to the next levelTraining these systems typically requires vast amounts of data, with some systems needing to scour millions of examples to learn how to carry out a task effectively -- although this is increasingly possible in an age of big data and widespread data mining. Training datasets are huge and growing in size --  Google\\'s Open Images Dataset has about nine million images, while its labelled video repository YouTube-8M links to seven million labelled videos. ImageNet, one of the early databases of this kind, has more than 14 million categorized images. Compiled over two years, it was put together by nearly 50,000 people -- most of whom were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk -- who checked, sorted, and labeled almost one billion candidate pictures.In the long run, having access to huge labelled datasets may also prove less important than access to large amounts of compute power.In recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks ( GANs) have shown how machine-learning systems that are fed a small amount of labelled data can then generate huge amounts of fresh data to teach themselves.This approach could lead to the rise of semi-supervised learning, where systems can learn how to carry out tasks using a far smaller amount of labelled data than is necessary for training systems using supervised learning today.Unsupervised learningIn contrast, unsupervised learning uses a different approach, where algorithms try to identify patterns in data, looking for similarities that can be used to categorise that data.An example might be clustering together fruits that weigh a similar amount or cars with a similar engine size.The algorithm isn\\'t setup in advance to pick out specific types of data, it simply looks for data that can be grouped by its similarities, for example Google News grouping together stories on similar topics each day.Reinforcement learningA crude analogy for reinforcement learning is rewarding a pet with a treat when it performs a trick.In reinforcement learning, the system attempts to maximise a reward based on its input data, basically going through a process of trial and error until it arrives at the best possible outcome.An example of reinforcement learning is Google DeepMind\\'s Deep Q-network, which  has been used to best human performance in a variety of classic video games. The system is fed pixels from each game and determines various information, such as the distance between objects on screen.By also looking at the score achieved in each game the system builds a model of which action will maximise the score in different circumstances, for instance, in the case of the video game Breakout, where the paddle should be moved to in order to intercept the ball.Many AI-related technologies are approaching, or have already reached, the \\'peak of inflated expectations\\' in Gartner\\'s Hype Cycle, with the backlash-driven \\'trough of disillusionment\\' lying in wait. \\n                                                    Image: Gartner / Annotations: ZDNet\\n                                                Which are the leading firms in AI?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                        Google\\'s DeepMind and the NHS: A glimpse of what AI means for the future of healthcare\\n                    \\n\\nThe Google subsidiary has struck a series of deals with organisations in the UK health service -- so what\\'s really happening?\\n\\nRead More\\n\\n\\nWith AI playing an increasingly major role in modern software and services, each of the major tech firms is battling to develop robust machine-learning technology for use in-house and to sell to the public via cloud services.Each regularly makes headlines for breaking new ground in AI research, although it is probably Google with its DeepMind AI AlphaGo that has probably made the biggest impact on the public awareness of AI.Which AI services are available?All of the major cloud platforms -- Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform -- provide access to GPU arrays for training and running machine learning models, with  Google also gearing up to let users use its Tensor Processing Units -- custom chips whose design is optimized for training and running machine-learning models.All of the necessary associated infrastructure and services are available from the big three, the cloud-based data stores, capable of holding the vast amount of data needed to train machine-learning models, services to transform data to prepare it for analysis, visualisation tools to display the results clearly, and software that simplifies the building of models.These cloud platforms are even simplifying the creation of custom machine-learning models, with Google recently revealing a service that automates the creation of AI models, called Cloud AutoML. This drag-and-drop service builds custom image-recognition models and requires the user to have no machine-learning expertise.Cloud-based, machine-learning services are constantly evolving, and at the start of 2018, Amazon revealed a host of new AWS offerings designed to streamline the process of training up machine-learning models. For those firms that don\\'t want to build their own machine learning models but instead want to consume AI-powered, on-demand services -- such as voice, vision, and language recognition -- Microsoft Azure stands out for the breadth of services on offer, closely followed by Google Cloud Platform and then AWS. Meanwhile IBM, alongside its more general on-demand offerings, is also attempting to sell sector-specific AI services aimed at everything from healthcare to retail, grouping these offerings together under its  IBM Watson umbrella -- and recently investing $2bn in buying The Weather Channel to unlock a trove of data to augment its AI services.Which of the major tech firms is winning the AI race?Internally, each of the tech giants -- and others such as Facebook -- use AI to help drive myriad public services: serving search results, offering recommendations, recognizing people and things in photos, on-demand translation, spotting spam -- the list is extensive.But one of the most visible manifestations of this AI war has been the rise of virtual assistants, such as Apple\\'s Siri, Amazon\\'s Alexa, the Google Assistant, and Microsoft Cortana.The Amazon Echo Plus is a smart speaker with access to Amazon\\'s Alexa virtual assistant built in. \\n                                                    Image: Jason Cipriani/ZDNet\\n                                                Relying heavily on voice recognition and natural-language processing, as well as needing an immense corpus to draw upon to answer queries, a huge amount of tech goes into developing these assistants.But while Apple\\'s Siri may have come to prominence first, it is Google and Amazon whose assistants have since overtaken Apple in the AI space -- Google Assistant with its ability to answer a wide range of queries and Amazon\\'s Alexa with the massive number of \\'Skills\\' that third-party devs have created to add to its capabilities.Read more: How we learned to talk to computers, and how they learned to answer back (PDF download)Despite being built into Windows 10, Cortana has had a particularly rough time of late, with the  suggestion that major PC makers will build Alexa into laptops adding to speculation about whether Cortana\\'s days are numbered, although Microsoft was quick to reject this.Which countries are leading the way in AI?It\\'d be a big mistake to think the US tech giants have the field of AI sewn up. Chinese firms Alibaba, Baidu, and Lenovo are investing heavily in AI in fields ranging from ecommerce to autonomous driving. As a country China is pursuing a three-step plan to turn AI into a core industry for the country,  one that will be worth 150 billion yuan ($22bn)  by 2020.Baidu has invested in developing self-driving cars, powered by its deep learning algorithm, Baidu AutoBrain, and, following several years of tests, plans to roll out fully autonomous vehicles in 2018 and mass-produce them by 2021.Baidu\\'s self-driving car, a modified BMW 3 series. \\n                                                    Image: Baidu\\n                                                Baidu has also partnered with Nvidia to use AI to create a cloud-to-car autonomous car platform for auto manufacturers around the world.The combination of weak privacy laws, huge investment, concerted data-gathering, and big data analytics by major firms like Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent, means that some analysts believe China will have an advantage over the US when it comes to future AI research, with one analyst describing the chances of  China taking the lead over the US as 500 to one in China\\'s favor.How can I get started with AI?While you could try to build your own GPU array at home and start training a machine-learning model, probably the easiest way to experiment with AI-related services is via the cloud.All of the major tech firms offer various AI services, from the infrastructure to build and train your own machine-learning models through to web services that allow you to access AI-powered tools such as speech, language, vision and sentiment recognition on demand.What are recent landmarks in the development of AI?There\\'s too many to put together a comprehensive list, but some recent highlights include: in 2009 Google showed it was possible for its self-driving Toyota Prius to complete more than 10 journeys of 100 miles each -- setting society on a path towards driverless vehicles.In 2011, the computer system  IBM Watson made headlines worldwide when it won the US quiz show Jeopardy!, beating two of the best players the show had ever produced. To win the show, Watson used natural language processing and analytics on vast repositories of data that it processed to answer human-posed questions, often in a fraction of a second.IBM Watson competes on Jeopardy! in January 14, 2011 \\n                                                    Image: IBM\\n                                                In June 2012, it became apparent just how good machine-learning systems were getting at computer vision, with  Google training a system to recognise an internet favorite, pictures of cats.Since Watson\\'s win, perhaps the most famous demonstration of the efficacy of machine-learning systems was  the 2016 triumph of the Google DeepMind AlphaGo AI over a human grandmaster in Go, an ancient Chinese game whose complexity stumped computers for decades. Go has about 200 moves per turn, compared to about 20 in Chess. Over the course of a game of Go, there are so many possible moves that searching through each of them in advance to identify the best play is too costly from a computational point of view. Instead, AlphaGo was trained how to play the game by taking moves played by human experts in 30 million Go games and feeding them into deep-learning neural networks.Training these deep learning networks can take a very long time, requiring vast amounts of data to be ingested and iterated over as the system gradually refines its model in order to achieve the best outcome.However,  more recently Google refined the training process with AlphaGo Zero, a system that played \"completely random\" games against itself, and then learnt from the results. At last year\\'s prestigious Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) conference, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis revealed AlphaGo had also mastered the games of chess and shogi.And AI continues to sprint past new milestones,  last year a system trained by OpenAI defeated the world\\'s top players in one-on-one matches of the online multiplayer game Dota 2.That same year, OpenAI created AI agents that invented their own  invented their own language to cooperate and achieve their goal more effectively, shortly followed by Facebook training agents to negotiate and even lie.How will AI change the world?Robots and driverless cars\\n\\n\\nSpecial report\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                        Tech and the future of transportation (free PDF)\\n                    \\n\\nThis ebook looks at emerging autonomous transport technologies and how they will affect society and the future of business.\\n\\nRead More\\n\\n\\nThe desire for robots to be able to act autonomously and understand and navigate the world around them means there is a natural overlap between robotics and AI. While AI is only one of the technologies used in robotics, use of AI is helping robots move into new areas such as  self-driving cars, delivery robots, as well as helping robots to learn new skills. General Motors recently said it would build a driverless car without a steering wheel or pedals by 2019, while Ford committed to doing so by 2021, and Waymo, the self-driving group inside Google parent Alphabet, will soon offer a driverless taxi service in Phoenix.Fake newsWe are on the verge of having neural networks that can  create photo-realistic images or replicate someone\\'s voice in a pitch-perfect fashion. With that comes the potential for hugely disruptive social change, such as no longer being able to trust video or audio footage as genuine. Concerns are also starting to be raised about how such technologies will be used to misappropriate people\\'s image, with tools already being created to convincingly splice famous actresses into adult films.Speech and language recognitionMachine-learning systems have helped computers recognise what people are saying with an accuracy of almost 95 percent. Recently Microsoft\\'s Artificial Intelligence and Research group reported it had developed a system able to transcribe spoken English as accurately as human transcribers.With researchers pursuing a goal of 99 percent accuracy, expect speaking to computers to become the norm alongside more traditional forms of human-machine interaction.Facial recognition and surveillanceIn recent years, the accuracy of facial-recognition systems has leapt forward, to the point where  Chinese tech giant Baidu says it can match faces with 99 percent accuracy, providing the face is clear enough on the video. While police forces in western countries have generally only trialled using facial-recognition systems at large events, in China the authorities are mounting a nationwide program to connect CCTV across the country to facial recognition and to use AI systems to track suspects and suspicious behavior, and are also trialling the use of facial-recognition glasses by police.Although privacy regulations vary across the world, it\\'s likely this more intrusive use of AI technology -- including AI that can recognize emotions -- will gradually become more widespread elsewhere.HealthcareAI could eventually have a dramatic impact on healthcare, helping radiologists to pick out tumors in x-rays, aiding researchers in spotting genetic sequences related to diseases and identifying molecules that could lead to more effective drugs. There have been trials of AI-related technology in hospitals across the world. These include IBM\\'s Watson clinical decision support tool, which is trained by oncologists at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and the use of Google DeepMind systems by the UK\\'s National Health Service, where it will help spot eye abnormalities and streamline the process of screening patients for head and neck cancers.Will AI kill us all?Again, it depends who you ask. As AI-powered systems have grown more capable, so warnings of the downsides have become more dire.Tesla and  SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has claimed that AI is a \"fundamental risk to the existence of human civilization\". As part of his push for stronger regulatory oversight and more responsible research into mitigating the downsides of AI he set up OpenAI, a non-profit artificial intelligence research company that aims to promote and develop friendly AI that will benefit society as a whole. Similarly, the esteemed physicist Stephen Hawking has warned that once a sufficiently advanced AI is created it will rapidly advance to the point at which it vastly outstrips human capabilities, a phenomenon known as the singularity, and could pose an existential threat to the human race.Yet the notion that humanity is on the verge of an AI explosion that will dwarf our intellect seems ludicrous to some AI researchers.Chris Bishop, Microsoft\\'s director of research in Cambridge, England,  stresses how different the narrow intelligence of AI today is from the general intelligence of humans, saying that when people worry about \"Terminator and the rise of the machines and so on? Utter nonsense, yes. At best, such discussions are decades away.\"Will an AI steal your job?The possibility of artificially intelligent systems replacing much of modern manual labour is perhaps a more credible near-future possibility.\\n\\n\\nSpecial feature\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                        Special report: IT Jobs in 2020: A leader\\'s guide (free PDF)\\n                    \\n\\nZDNet and TechRepublic looks at the dramatic effect of AI, big data, cloud computing, and automation on IT jobs, and how companies can adapt.\\n\\nRead More\\n\\n\\nWhile AI won\\'t replace all jobs, what seems to be certain is that AI will change the nature of work, with the only question being how rapidly and how profoundly automation will alter the workplace.There is barely a field of human endeavour that AI doesn\\'t have the potential to impact. As AI expert Andrew Ng puts it: \"many people are doing routine, repetitive jobs. Unfortunately, technology is especially good at automating routine, repetitive work\", saying he sees a \"significant risk of technological unemployment over the next few decades\".The evidence of which jobs will be supplanted is starting to emerge. Amazon has just  launched Amazon Go, a cashier-free supermarket in Seattle where customers just take items from the shelves and walk out. What this means for the more than three million people in the US who works as cashiers remains to be seen. Amazon again is leading the way in using robots to improve efficiency inside its warehouses. These robots carry shelves of products to human pickers who select items to be sent out. Amazon has more than 100,000 bots in its fulfilment centers, with plans to add many more. But Amazon also stresses that as the number of bots have grown, so has the number of human workers in these warehouses. However, Amazon and small robotics firms are working to automate the remaining manual jobs in the warehouse, so it\\'s not a given that manual and robotic labor will continue to grow hand-in-hand.Amazon bought Kiva robotics in 2012 and today uses Kiva robots throughout its warehouses. \\n                                                    Image: Amazon\\n                                                Fully autonomous self-driving vehicles aren\\'t a reality yet, but by some predictions the  self-driving trucking industry alone is poised to take over 1.7 million jobs in the next decade, even without considering the impact on couriers and taxi drivers.Yet some of the easiest jobs to automate won\\'t even require robotics. At present there are millions of people working in administration, entering and copying data between systems, chasing and booking appointments for companies. As software gets better at automatically updating systems and flagging the information that\\'s important, so the need for administrators will fall.As with every technological shift, new jobs will be created to replace those lost. However,  what\\'s uncertain is whether these new roles will be created rapidly enough to offer employment to those displaced, and whether the newly unemployed will have the necessary skills or temperament to fill these emerging roles.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                        Artificial intelligence: It\\'s about to cause a major upheaval in jobs\\n                    \\n\\nAdvances in computer vision, speech, analytics, and mobile robotics promise to affect any jobs related to these skills.\\n\\nRead More\\n\\n\\nNot everyone is a pessimist. For some,  AI is a technology that will augment, rather than replace, workers. Not only that but they argue there will be a commercial imperative to not replace people outright, as an AI-assisted worker -- think a human concierge with an AR headset that tells them exactly what a client wants before they ask for it -- will be more productive or effective than an AI working on its own.Among AI experts there\\'s a broad range of opinion about how quickly artificially intelligent systems will surpass human capabilities.Oxford University\\'s Future of Humanity Institute  asked several hundred machine-learning experts to predict AI capabilities, over the coming decades.Notable dates included AI writing essays that could pass for being written by a human by 2026, truck drivers being made redundant by 2027, AI surpassing human capabilities in retail by 2031, writing a best-seller by 2049, and doing a surgeon\\'s work by 2053.They estimated there was a relatively high chance that AI beats humans at all tasks within 45 years and automates all human jobs within 120 years.Related coverageHow ML and AI will transform business intelligence and analyticsMachine learning and artificial intelligence advances in five areas will ease data prep, discovery, analysis, prediction, and data-driven decision making.Report: Artificial intelligence is creating jobs, generating economic gainsNew study from Deloitte shows that early adopters of cognitive technologies are positive about their current and future role.AI and jobs: Where humans are better than algorithms, and vice versaIt\\'s easy to get caught up in the doom-and-gloom predictions about artificial intelligence wiping out millions of jobs.

How Does Blockchain Work?  31 Blockchain Companies Paving the Way for the FutureWe\\'ve rounded up 31 interesting examples of US-based companies using blockchain.  Read Article   Why Mastercard\\'s Blockchain Focuses on Practical Applications See More StoriesBlockchain 101Blockchain technology is most simply defined as a\\xc2\\xa0decentralized, distributed ledger that records\\xc2\\xa0the provenance of a digital asset. Our guide will walk you through what it is, how it\\'s used and its history.\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0OverviewUsesHistoryOverviewBlockchain is most simply defined as a\\xc2\\xa0decentralized, distributed ledger technology that records\\xc2\\xa0the provenance of a digital asset.What is Blockchain Technology?Blockchain, sometimes referred to as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT),\\xc2\\xa0makes the history of any digital asset unalterable and transparent through the use of decentralization and cryptographic hashing.\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0A simple analogy\\xc2\\xa0for understanding blockchain technology is a Google Doc. When we create a document and share it with a group of people, the document is distributed instead of copied or transferred.\\xc2\\xa0This creates a decentralized distribution chain that gives everyone access to the document at the same time. No one is locked out awaiting changes from another party, while all modifications to the doc are being recorded in real-time, making changes completely transparent.Of course, blockchain is more complicated than a Google Doc, but the analogy is apt because\\xc2\\xa0it\\xc2\\xa0illustrates three critical ideas\\xc2\\xa0of the technology:Blockchain Explained: A Quick OverviewDigital assets are distributed instead of copied or transferred.The asset is decentralized, allowing full real-time access.A transparent ledger of changes preserves integrity of the document, which creates trust in the asset.Blockchain is an especially promising and revolutionary technology because it helps reduce risk, stamps out fraud and brings transparency in a scaleable way for myriad uses.\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0How Does Blockchain Work?The whole point of using a blockchain is to let people \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in particular, people who don\\'t trust one another \\xe2\\x80\\x94 share valuable data in a secure, tamperproof way.\\xe2\\x80\\x94 MIT Technology ReviewBlockchain consists of three important concepts: blocks, nodes and miners.BlocksEvery chain consists of multiple blocks and each block has three\\xc2\\xa0basic elements:The data in the block.A 32-bit whole number called a nonce. The nonce is randomly generated when a block is created, which then generates a block header hash.\\xc2\\xa0The hash is a 256-bit number wedded to the nonce. It must start with a huge number of zeroes (i.e., be extremely small).When the first block of a chain is created, a nonce generates the cryptographic hash. The data in the\\xc2\\xa0block is considered signed and forever tied to the nonce and hash unless it is mined.\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0MinersMiners create new blocks on the chain through a process called mining.In a blockchain every block has its\\xc2\\xa0own unique nonce and hash, but also references the hash of the previous block in the chain, so mining a block isn\\'t easy, especially on large chains.Miners use special software to solve the incredibly complex math problem of finding\\xc2\\xa0a nonce that generates an accepted hash. Because the nonce is only 32 bits and the hash is 256, there are roughly four billion possible nonce-hash combinations that must be mined before the right one is found. When that happens miners are said to have found the \"golden nonce\" and their block is added to the chain.\\xc2\\xa0Making\\xc2\\xa0a change to any block earlier in the chain requires re-mining not just the block with the change, but all of the blocks that come after. This is why it\\'s extremely difficult to manipulate blockchain technology. Think of it is as \"safety in math\" since\\xc2\\xa0finding golden nonces requires an enormous amount of time and\\xc2\\xa0computing power.When a\\xc2\\xa0block is successfully mined, the change is accepted by all of the nodes on the network and the miner is rewarded financially.NodesOne of the most important concepts in blockchain technology is decentralization. No one computer or organization can own the chain. Instead, it is a distributed ledger via the nodes connected to the chain. Nodes can be any kind of electronic device that maintains copies of the blockchain and keeps the network functioning.\\xc2\\xa0Every node has its own copy of the blockchain and the network must algorithmically approve any newly mined block for the chain to be updated, trusted and verified. Since blockchains are transparent, every action in the ledger can be easily checked and viewed. Each participant is given a\\xc2\\xa0unique alphanumeric identification number that shows their transactions.Combining public information with a system of checks-and-balances helps the blockchain maintain integrity and creates trust among users. Essentially, blockchains can be thought of as the scaleability of trust via technology.\\xc2\\xa0Check Out the Top Companies in the Nation\\'s Hottest Blockchain Hubs\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0UsesBeyond Bitcoin: Ethereum BlockchainOriginally created as the ultra-transparent ledger system for Bitcoin to operate on, blockchain has long been associated with cryptocurrency, but the technology\\'s transparency and security has seen growing adoption in a number of areas, much of which can be traced back to the development of the Ethereum blockchain.\\xc2\\xa0In late 2013, Russian-Canadian\\xc2\\xa0developer Vitalik Buterin published a white paper\\xc2\\xa0that proposed a platform combining traditional blockchain functionality with one key difference: the\\xc2\\xa0execution of\\xc2\\xa0computer code. Thus, the Ethereum Project was born.\\xc2\\xa0Ethereum blockchain lets developers create sophisticated programs that can communicate with one another on the blockchain.TokensEthereum programmers can create tokens to represent any kind of digital asset, track its ownership and execute its functionality according to a set of programming instructions.Tokens can be music files, contracts, concert tickets or even a\\xc2\\xa0patient\\'s medical records. This has broadened the potential of blockchain to permeate other sectors like media, government and identity security.\\xc2\\xa0Thousands of companies are currently researching and developing products and ecosystems that run entirely on the burgeoning technology.Blockchain is challenging the current status quo of innovation by letting companies experiment with groundbreaking technology like peer-to-peer energy distribution or decentralized forms for news media. Much like the definition of blockchain, the uses for the ledger system will only evolve as technology evolves.Blockchain ApplicationsBlockchain has a nearly endless amount of applications across almost every industry. The ledger technology can be applied to track fraud in finance, securely share patient medical records between healthcare professionals and even acts as a better way to track intellectual property in business and music rights for artists.HistoryHistory of BlockchainAlthough blockchain is a new technology, it already boasts a\\xc2\\xa0rich and interesting history.

Opinion surveys show that even top business leaders lack a detailed sense of AI and that many ordinary people confuse it with super-powered robots or hyper-intelligent devices. Hollywood helps little in this regard by fusing robots and advanced software into self-replicating automatons such as the Terminator\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Skynet or the evil HAL seen in Arthur Clarke\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9c2001: A Space Odyssey,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which goes rogue after humans plan to deactivate it. The lack of clarity around the term enables technology pessimists to warn AI will conquer humans, suppress individual freedom, and destroy personal privacy through a digital \\xe2\\x80\\x9c1984.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDarrell M. West\\nVice President and Director - Governance Studies Senior Fellow - Center for Technology Innovation\\n\\n Twitter\\n@DarrWest\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPart of the problem is the lack of a uniformly agreed upon definition. Alan Turing generally is credited with the origin of the concept when he speculated in 1950 about \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthinking machines\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that could reason at the level of a human being. His well-known \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTuring Test\\xe2\\x80\\x9d specifies that computers need to complete reasoning puzzles as well as humans in order to be considered \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthinking\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in an autonomous manner.\\nTuring was followed up a few years later by John McCarthy, who first used the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cartificial intelligence\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to denote machines that could think autonomously. He described the threshold as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgetting a computer to do things which, when done by people, are said to involve intelligence.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nSince the 1950s, scientists have argued over what constitutes \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthinking\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cintelligence,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and what is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfully autonomous\\xe2\\x80\\x9d when it comes to hardware and software. Advanced computers such as the IBM Watson already have beaten humans at chess and are capable of instantly processing enormous amounts of information.\\nThe lack of clarity around the term enables technology pessimists to warn AI will conquer humans, suppress individual freedom, and destroy personal privacy through a digital \\xe2\\x80\\x9c1984.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nToday, AI generally is thought to refer to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmachines that respond to stimulation consistent with traditional responses from humans, given the human capacity for contemplation, judgment, and intention.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d According to researchers Shubhendu and Vijay, these software systems \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmake decisions which normally require [a] human level of expertise\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and help people anticipate problems or deal with issues as they come up. As argued by John Allen and myself in an April 2018 paper, such systems have three qualities that constitute the essence of artificial intelligence: intentionality, intelligence, and adaptability.\\nIn the remainder of this paper, I discuss these qualities and why it is important to make sure each accords with basic human values. Each of the AI features has the potential to move civilization forward in progressive ways. But without adequate safeguards or the incorporation of ethical considerations, the AI utopia can quickly turn into dystopia.\\nIntentionality\\nArtificial intelligence algorithms are designed to make decisions, often using real-time data. They are unlike passive machines that are capable only of mechanical or predetermined responses. Using sensors, digital data, or remote inputs, they combine information from a variety of different sources, analyze the material instantly, and act on the insights derived from those data. As such, they are designed by humans with intentionality and reach conclusions based on their instant analysis.\\nAn example from the transportation industry shows how this happens. Autonomous vehicles are equipped with LIDARS (light detection and ranging) and remote sensors that gather information from the vehicle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s surroundings. The LIDAR uses light from a radar to see objects in front of and around the vehicle and make instantaneous decisions regarding the presence of objects, distances, and whether the car is about to hit something. On-board computers combine this information with sensor data to determine whether there are any dangerous conditions, the vehicle needs to shift lanes, or it should slow or stop completely. All of that material has to be analyzed instantly to avoid crashes and keep the vehicle in the proper lane.\\n\\nRelated\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nTechnology & Innovation\\nHow artificial intelligence is transforming the world\\n\\nDarrell M. West and John R. Allen\\nTuesday, April 24, 2018\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nTechnology & Innovation\\nAlgorithmic bias detection and mitigation: Best practices and policies to reduce consumer harms\\n\\nNicol Turner Lee, Paul Resnick, and Genie Barton\\nWednesday, May 22, 2019\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nTechnology & Innovation\\nProtecting privacy in an AI-driven world\\n\\nCameron F. Kerry\\nMonday, February 10, 2020\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWith massive improvements in storage systems, processing speeds, and analytic techniques, these algorithms are capable of tremendous sophistication in analysis and decisionmaking. Financial algorithms can spot minute differentials in stock valuations and undertake market transactions that take advantage of that information. The same logic applies in environmental sustainability systems that use sensors to determine whether someone is in a room and automatically adjusts heating, cooling, and lighting based on that information. The goal is to conserve energy and use resources in an optimal manner.\\nAs long as these systems conform to important human values, there is little risk of AI going rogue or endangering human beings. Computers can be intentional while analyzing information in ways that augment humans or help them perform at a higher level. However, if the software is poorly designed or based on incomplete or biased information, it can endanger humanity or replicate past injustices.\\nIntelligence\\nAI often is undertaken in conjunction with machine learning and data analytics, and the resulting combination enables intelligent decisionmaking. Machine learning takes data and looks for underlying trends. If it spots something that is relevant for a practical problem, software designers can take that knowledge and use it with data analytics to understand specific issues.\\nFor example, there are AI systems for managing school enrollments. They compile information on neighborhood location, desired schools, substantive interests, and the like, and assign pupils to particular schools based on that material. As long as there is little contentiousness or disagreement regarding basic criteria, these systems work intelligently and effectively.\\nFiguring out how to reconcile conflicting values is one of the most important challenges facing AI designers. It is vital that they write code and incorporate information that is unbiased and non-discriminatory. Failure to do that leads to AI algorithms that are unfair and unjust.\\nOf course, that often is not the case. Reflecting the importance of education for life outcomes, parents, teachers, and school administrators fight over the importance of different factors. Should students always be assigned to their neighborhood school or should other criteria override that consideration? As an illustration, in a city with widespread racial segregation and economic inequalities by neighborhood, elevating neighborhood school assignments can exacerbate inequality and racial segregation. For these reasons, software designers have to balance competing interests and reach intelligent decisions that reflect values important in that particular community.\\nMaking these kinds of decisions increasingly falls to computer programmers. They must build intelligent algorithms that compile decisions based on a number of different considerations. That can include basic principles such as efficiency, equity, justice, and effectiveness. Figuring out how to reconcile conflicting values is one of the most important challenges facing AI designers. It is vital that they write code and incorporate information that is unbiased and non-discriminatory. Failure to do that leads to AI algorithms that are unfair and unjust.\\nAdaptability\\nThe last quality that marks AI systems is the ability to learn and adapt as they compile information and make decisions. Effective artificial intelligence must adjust as circumstances or conditions shift. This may involve alterations in financial situations, road conditions, environmental considerations, or military circumstances. AI must integrate these changes in its algorithms and make decisions on how to adapt to the new possibilities.\\nOne can illustrate these issues most dramatically in the transportation area. Autonomous vehicles can use machine-to-machine communications to alert other cars on the road about upcoming congestion, potholes, highway construction, or other possible traffic impediments. Vehicles can take advantage of the experience of other vehicles on the road, without human involvement, and the entire corpus of their achieved \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexperience\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is immediately and fully transferable to other similarly configured vehicles. Their advanced algorithms, sensors, and cameras incorporate experience in current operations, and use dashboards and visual displays to present information in real time so human drivers are able to make sense of ongoing traffic and vehicular conditions.\\nA similar logic applies to AI devised for scheduling appointments. There are personal digital assistants that can ascertain a person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s preferences and respond to email requests for personal appointments in a dynamic manner. Without any human intervention, a digital assistant can make appointments, adjust schedules, and communicate those preferences to other individuals. Building adaptable systems that learn as they go has the potential of improving effectiveness and efficiency. These kinds of algorithms can handle complex tasks and make judgments that replicate or exceed what a human could do. But making sure they \\xe2\\x80\\x9clearn\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in ways that are fair and just is a high priority for system designers.\\nConclusion\\nIn short, there have been extraordinary advances in recent years in the ability of AI systems to incorporate intentionality, intelligence, and adaptability in their algorithms. Rather than being mechanistic or deterministic in how the machines operate, AI software learns as it goes along and incorporates real-world experience in its decisionmaking. In this way, it enhances human performance and augments people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s capabilities.\\nOf course, these advances also make people nervous about doomsday scenarios sensationalized by movie-makers. Situations where AI-powered robots take over from humans or weaken basic values frighten people and lead them to wonder whether AI is making a useful contribution or runs the risk of endangering the essence of humanity.\\nWith the appropriate safeguards,\\xc2\\xa0countries can move forward and gain the benefits of artificial intelligence and emerging technologies without sacrificing the important qualities that define humanity.\\nThere is no easy answer to that question, but system designers must incorporate important ethical values in algorithms to make sure they correspond to human concerns and learn and adapt in ways that are consistent with community values. This is the reason it is important to ensure that AI ethics are taken seriously and permeate societal decisions. In order to maximize positive outcomes, organizations should hire ethicists who work with corporate decisionmakers and software developers, have a code of AI ethics that lays out how various issues will be handled, organize an AI review board that regularly addresses corporate ethical questions, have AI audit trails that show how various coding decisions have been made, implement AI training programs so staff operationalizes ethical considerations in their daily work, and provide a means for remediation when AI solutions inflict harm or damages on people or organizations.\\nThrough these kinds of safeguards, societies will increase the odds that AI systems are intentional, intelligent, and adaptable while still conforming to basic human values. In that way, countries can move forward and gain the benefits of artificial intelligence and emerging technologies without sacrificing the important qualities that define humanity.\\n\\n\\n\\nReport Produced by Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technology Initiative\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated Topics\\n\\nTechnology & Innovation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n The Brookings Institution\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Facebook\\nFind us on Facebook\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Twitter\\nFind us on Twitter\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n YouTube\\nFind us on YouTube\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Podcast\\nListen to our Podcast\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Browse Newsletters\\nBrowse Newsletters\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n RSS\\nSubscribe to our RSS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLanguages\\nEspa\\xc3\\xb1ol\\n\\xe4\\xb8\\xad\\xe6\\x96\\x87\\n\\xd8\\xb9\\xd8\\xb1\\xd8\\xa8\\xd9\\x8a\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout Us\\nResearch Programs\\nFind an Expert\\nCareers\\nContact\\nTerms and Conditions\\nBrookings Privacy Policy\\nCopyright 2020 The Brookings Institution\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n The Brookings Institution\\n\\n Close\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTrending\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tU.S. Politics & Government\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCoronavirus (COVID-19) Economics\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAI\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPolicy 2020\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCities & Regions\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGlobal Dev\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIntl Affairs\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tU.S. Economy\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tU.S. Politics & Govt\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMore\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbout Us\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPress Room\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tExperts\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tEvents\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Brookings Press\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWashU at Brookings\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCareers\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSupport Brookings\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nCart\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGet daily updates from Brookings\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\nEnter Email\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Close\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSend to Email Address\\n\\nYour Name\\n\\nYour Email Address\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCancel\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPost was not sent - check your email addresses!\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tEmail check failed, please try again\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSorry, your blog cannot share posts by email.\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

So what does it all mean?\\xc2\\xa0\\nLet's start with some quick definitions. Blockchain is the technology that enables the existence of cryptocurrency (among other things). Bitcoin is the name of the best-known cryptocurrency, the one for which blockchain technology was invented. A cryptocurrency is a medium of exchange, such as the US dollar, but is digital and uses encryption techniques to control the creation of monetary units and to verify the transfer of funds.\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is blockchain technology?\\nA blockchain is a decentralized ledger of all transactions across a peer-to-peer network. Using this technology, participants can confirm transactions without a need for a central clearing authority. Potential applications can include fund transfers, settling trades, voting, and many other issues.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShare graphic\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShare graphic\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShare graphic\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShare graphic\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShare graphic\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBlockchain also has potential applications far beyond bitcoin and cryptocurrency.\\nFrom a business perspective, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s helpful to think of blockchain technology as a type of next-generation business process improvement software. Collaborative technology, such as blockchain, promises the ability to improve the business processes that occur between companies, radically lowering the \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccost of trust.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d For this reason, it may offer significantly higher returns for each investment dollar spent than most traditional internal investments.\\nFinancial institutions are exploring how they could also use blockchain technology to upend everything from clearing and settlement to insurance. These articles will help you understand these changes\\xe2\\x80\\x94and what you should do about them.\\nFor an overview of cryptocurrency, start with Money is no object from 2015. We explore the early days of bitcoin and provide survey data on consumer familiarity, usage, and more. We also look at how market participants, such as investors, technology providers, and financial institutions, will be affected as the market matures.\\nFor a deeper dive into cryptocurrencies, we recommend that you read the following:\\n\\xe2\\x97\\x8f\\xc2\\xa0Carving up crypto provides an overview of how regulators are thinking about cryptocurrency in financial services, both in the United States and abroad.\\n\\xe2\\x97\\x8f In Cryptocurrencies: Time to consider plan B, we explore possible avenues for accounting treatment on cryptocurrencies.\\n\\xe2\\x97\\x8f For board members, Ten questions every board should ask about cryptocurrencies suggests questions to consider when engaging in a conversation about the strategic potential of cryptocurrencies.\\nFor an overview of blockchain in financial services, visit this page: Blockchain in financial services. We examine some of the ways FS firms are using blockchain, and how we expect the blockchain technology to develop in the future. Blockchain isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a cure-all, but there are clearly many problems for which this technology is the ideal solution.\\nFor a deeper dive on specific topics related to blockchain, we recommend:\\n\\xe2\\x97\\x8f\\xc2\\xa0A strategist\\xe2\\x80\\x99s guide to blockchain examines the potential benefits of this important innovation\\xe2\\x80\\x94and also suggests a way forward for financial institutions.

Depends on whether or not that lightbulb is connected to Wi-Fi.Lightbulbs, along with refrigerators, coffee makers, microwave ovens, baby monitors, security cameras, speakers, televisions, and thermostats have, in the past few decades, transformed from ordinary objects into conduits for the future. Embedded with sensors that see, hear, and touch the world around them, they can turn physical information into digital data. Collectively, these devices\\xe2\\x80\\x94and there are billions of them around the world\\xe2\\x80\\x94make up the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinternet of things.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dJust about anything with network connectivity belongs to the internet of things, from security cameras and speakers to smart watches and denim jackets. In the \\xe2\\x80\\x9csmart home,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d these internet-enabled gadgets liberate us from our chores, give us back some of our time, and add a dash of novelty to ordinary experiences. (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlexa, turn on the disco lights.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) But the internet of things is about more than just using your voice to preheat the oven or using your phone to turn off the lights. The real promise of the internet of things is making our physical surroundings accessible to our digital computers, putting sensors on everything in the world and translating it into a digital format. Internet-connected objects could be the key to unlocking predictions about everything from consumer behavior to climate events, but those same objects could invite hackers into personal spaces and leak intimate data. Depending on who you ask, the growing internet of things either represents the promise of technology\\xe2\\x80\\x94the thing that will reinvent modern life as we know it\\xe2\\x80\\x94or that which will be our technological undoing.The History of the Internet of ThingsThe dream of a sensory computer as the centerpiece of the smart home has occupied the popular imagination for at least half a century. Sci-fi writers like Ray Bradbury and television shows like The Jetsons brought the automated house to life, and inventors began creating prototypes for exhibitions around the world, showing off ideas for self-cleaning homes and furniture that could move itself around for its occupants.The net benefit of these gizmos was, for the most part, liberation from housework. At the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, Whirlpool created an exhibit called the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiracle Kitchen\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94a futuristic display meant to show what life in capitalist America was like. It included a dishwasher that cleared the table and a proto-Roomba to sweep the floors. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn America, we like to make life easier for women,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Richard Nixon said to Nikita Khrushchev, the President of the Soviet Union, in an apparent jab on the showfloor.AdvertisementMost of the early smart home inventions used automatic controls, making it possible to turn something or off without lifting a finger. But they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t connect to anything else, and their functionality was limited. That would begin to change in 1983 when ARPANET, the earliest version of the internet, adopted the internet protocol suite (also known as TCP/IP). The protocol set standards for how digital data should be transmitted, routed, and received. Essentially, it laid the groundwork for the modern internet.IoT Through the Years1990John Romkey creates the first IoT device: a toaster that he controls with his computer1999Kevin Ashton coins the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinternet of things\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to describe the eyes and ears of a computer2000LG introduces its first connected refrigerator with a $20,000 pricetag2008The world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first IoT conference is held in Zurich, Switzerland2010Tony Fadell founds Nest, maker of the smart thermostat2013Oxford Dictionary adds the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinternet of things\\xe2\\x80\\x9d2014Amazon introduces the Echo speaker, along with the Alexa voice assistant\\xe2\\x80\\x94a new way to control the smart home2016The Mirai botnet infects over 600,000 IoT devices with malware2020The number of internet-connected devices, by some estimates, exceeds 20 billionThe first internet-connected \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to make use of this new protocol was a toaster. John Romkey, a software engineer and early internet evangelist, had built one for the 1990 showfloor of Interop, a trade show for computers. Romkey dropped a few slices of bread into the toaster and, using a clunky computer, turned the toaster on. It would still be a decade before anyone used the phrase \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinternet of things,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but Romkey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s magic little toaster showed what a world of internet-connected things might be like. (Of course, it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fully automated; a person still had to introduce the bread.) It was part gimmick, part proof of concept\\xe2\\x80\\x94and fully a preview of what was to come.The term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinternet of things\\xe2\\x80\\x9d itself was coined in 1999, when Kevin Ashton put it in a PowerPoint presentation for Procter & Gamble. Ashton, who was then working in supply chain optimization, described a system where sensors acted like the eyes and ears of a computer\\xe2\\x80\\x94an entirely new way for computers to see, hear, touch, and interpret their surroundings.As home internet became ubiquitous and Wi-Fi sped up, the dream of the smart home started to look more like a reality. Companies began to introduce more and more of these inventions: \\xe2\\x80\\x9csmart\\xe2\\x80\\x9d coffee makers to brew the perfect cup, ovens that bake cookies with precision timing, and refrigerators that automatically restocked expired milk. The first of these, LG\\xe2\\x80\\x99s internet-connected refrigerator, hit the market in 2000. It could take stock of shelf contents, mind expiration dates, and for some reason, came with an MP3 player. It also cost $20,000. As sensors became cheaper, these internet-connected devices became more affordable for more consumers. And the invention of smart plugs, like those made by Belkin, meant that even ordinary objects could become \\xe2\\x80\\x9csmart\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94or, at least, you could turn them on and off with your phone.Any IoT system today contains a few basic components. First, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the thing outfitted with sensors. These sensors could be anything that collects data, like a camera inside a smart refrigerator or an accelerometer that tracks speed in a smart running shoe. In some cases, sensors are bundled together to gather multiple data points: a Nest thermostat contains a thermometer, but also a motion sensor; it can adjust the temperature of a room when it senses that nobody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in it. To make sense of this data, the device has some kind of network connectivity (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular, or satellite) and a processor where it can be stored and analyzed. From there, the data can be used to trigger an action\\xe2\\x80\\x94like ordering more milk when the carton in the smart refrigerator runs out, or adjusting the temperature automatically given a set of rules.Most people didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t start building an ecosystem of \\xe2\\x80\\x9csmart\\xe2\\x80\\x9d devices in their homes until the mass adoption of voice controls. In 2014, Amazon introduced the Echo, a speaker with a helpful voice assistant named Alexa built in. Apple had introduced Siri, its own voice assistant, four years prior\\xe2\\x80\\x94but Siri lived on your phone, while Alexa lived inside the speaker and could control all of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9csmart\\xe2\\x80\\x9d devices in your house. Positioning a voice assistant as the centerpiece of the smart home had several effects: It demystified the internet of things for consumers, encouraged them to buy more internet-enabled gadgets, and encouraged developers to create more \\xe2\\x80\\x9cskills,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or IoT commands, for these voice assistants to learnThe same year that Amazon debuted Alexa, Apple came out with HomeKit, a system designed to facilitate interactions between Apple-made smart devices, sending data back and forth to create a network. These unifying voices have shifted the landscape away from single-purpose automations and toward a more holistic system of connected things. Tell the Google Assistant \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgoodnight,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for example, and the command can dim the lights, lock the front door, set the alarm system, and turn on your alarm clock. LG\\xe2\\x80\\x99s SmartThinQ platform connects many home appliances, so you can select a chocolate chip cookie recipe from the screen of your smart fridge and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll automatically preheat the oven. Manufacturers bill this as the future, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also a convenient way to sell more IoT devices. If you already have an Amazon Echo, you might as well get some stuff for Alexa to control.By 2014, the number of internet-connected devices would surpass the number of people in the world. David Evans, the former chief futurist at Cisco, estimated in 2015 that \\xe2\\x80\\x9can average 127 new things are connected to the internet\\xe2\\x80\\x9d every second. Today, there are over 20 billion connected things in the world, according to estimates from Gartner. The excitement around the brave new internet-connected world has been matched with concern. All of these objects, brought to life like Pinocchio, have made the world easier to control: You can let the delivery man in the front door, or change the temperature inside the house, all with a few taps on a smartphone. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also given our objects\\xe2\\x80\\x94and the companies that make them\\xe2\\x80\\x94more control over us.AdvertisementThe internet of things brings all the benefits of the internet to items like lightbulbs and thermostats, but it brings all the problems of the internet, too. Now that people have their speakers, television sets, refrigerators, alarm clocks, toothbrushes, light bulbs, doorbells, baby monitors, and security cameras connected to the Wi-Fi, nearly every device in the house can be compromised, or rendered useless. Consider the whims of internet connectivity: When your Wi-Fi goes down, so do your devices. Router problems? That means you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t turn on the heat with your smart thermostat, or unlock your smart door lock. Things that used to be easy become potentially faulty, if not impossible, when they require an Alexa command or a smartphone control rather than a physical button. Many of these devices also run on proprietary software\\xe2\\x80\\x94meaning, if their manufacturer goes bunk, gets sold, or stops issuing software updates, your clever little gadget becomes a useless hunk of plastic.Risk of bricking aside, connecting things to the internet also leaves those objects, and everything else on your Wi-Fi network, more vulnerable to hackers. Laura DeNardis, in her recent book The Internet in Everything, has called this threat to cybersecurity the greatest human rights issue of our time. The risk isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just that some prankster breaks into your smart washing machine and upsets the spin cycle, or that your Nest camera gets hijacked with a message to subscribe to PewDiePie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s YouTube channel. (Yes, that really happened.) A hacked smart lock means someone can open your front door. Hack into enough smart water heaters and you can send a city into a massive blackout. And one vulnerable device can compromise the whole network. As WIRED\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Lily Hay Newman points out, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIoT devices have been conscripted into massive botnets, compromised for nation-state reconnaissance, hacked to mine cryptocurrency, and manipulated in assaults on power grids.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dThe threat to internet-connected devices comes not just because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re connected to the internet, but because device manufacturers have not always designed their products with security as a priority. In 2016, malware called Mirai exploited these kinds of vulnerabilities in over 600,000 IoT devices to create a massive distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. The following year, an attack called Krack infected nearly every internet-connected device connected to Wi-Fi. The attack was crippling and difficult to defend against, in part because the internet of things runs on so many disparate operating systems. When a phone or a computer gets hit with a virus, software makers are generally quick to issue a patch. But things like routers or internet-connected doorbells don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t usually receive software updates needed to protect against vulnerabilities, and many of them weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t built with the same kind of security protocols as computers. After the Krack attack, one security researcher predicted that we would stitll \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfind vulnerable devices 20 years from now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dThen there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the question of privacy. If cameras and microphones are studded around your home, they are definitely watching and listening to you. Everything in the internet of things collects data\\xe2\\x80\\x94and all that data has value. In a recent study, researchers found that 72 of the 81 IoT devices they surveyed had shared data with a third party unrelated to the original manufacturer. That means the finer details of your personal life\\xe2\\x80\\x94as depicted by your smart toothbrush, your smart TV, or your smart speaker\\xe2\\x80\\x94can be repackaged and sold to someone else. Google and Apple both admitted, last year, that the recordings captured by their smart speakers are reviewed by contractors, including awkward and intimate snippets of audio. Amazon has partnerships with over 400 police departments, who use the footage from its Ring doorbell cameras to keep watch on neighborhoods. An ever-expanding internet of things doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just have consequences for personal privacy. It can create a network of computer eyes and ears everywhere we go.AdvertisementThe Future of the Internet of ThingsOne day, the internet of things will become the internet of everything. The objects in our world might sense and react to us individually all the time, so that a smart thermostat automatically adjusts based on your body temperature or the house automatically locks itself when you get into bed. Your clothes might come with connected sensors, too, so that the things around you can respond to your movements in real time. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s already starting to happen: In 2017, Google announced Project Jacquard, an effort to create the connected wardrobe of the future.This vision extends far beyond your clothes, and even your home. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll also have smart offices, smart buildings, smart cities. Smart hospital rooms will have sensors to ensure that doctors wash their hands, and airborne sensors will help cities predict mudslides and other natural disasters. Autonomous vehicles will connect to the internet and drive along roads studded with sensors, and governments will manage the demands on their energy grids by tracking household energy consumption through the internet of things. The growth of the internet of things could also lead to new kinds of cyber warfare; imagine a bad actor disabling every smart thermostat in the dead of winter, or hacking into internet-connected pacemakers and insulin pumps. It could create new class systems: those with robot maids, and those without. Or, as Ray Bradbury described in one short story from 1950, all the people might disappear\\xe2\\x80\\x94but the smart homes, preparing meals and sweeping the floors, will live on.If we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get there\\xe2\\x80\\x94whether we like \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or not\\xe2\\x80\\x94we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to need faster internet. (Enter: 5G.) We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll also need to keep all those devices from mucking up the airwaves, and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll need to find a better way to secure the data that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s transmitted across those airwaves. Recently, the Swiss cryptography firm Teserakt introduced an idea for a cryptographic implant for IoT devices, which would protect the data that streams from these devices. There are also ideas for creating a better standard for IoT devices, and plans to help them get along with each other, regardless of which company makes them or which voice assistant lives inside. However the internet of things changes the future, first they just need to work.

It\\'s a concept that not only has the potential to impact how we live but also how we work. But what exactly is the \"Internet of things\" and what impact is it going to have on you, if any? There are a lot of complexities around the \"Internet of things\" but I want to stick to the basics. Lots of technical and policy-related conversations are being had but many people are still just trying to grasp the foundation of what the heck these conversations are about.\\nLet\\'s start with understanding a few things.\\nBroadband Internet is become more widely available, the cost of connecting is decreasing, more devices are being created with Wi-Fi capabilities and sensors built into them, technology costs are going down, and smartphone penetration is sky-rocketing. \\xc2\\xa0All of these things are creating a \"perfect storm\" for the IoT.\\nWatch on Forbes:\\n\\n\\nSo What Is The Internet Of Things?\\nSimply put, this is the concept of basically connecting any device with an on and off switch to the Internet (and/or to each other). This includes everything from cellphones, coffee makers, washing machines, headphones, lamps, wearable devices and almost anything else you can think of. \\xc2\\xa0This also applies to components of machines, for example a jet engine of an airplane or the drill of an oil rig. As I mentioned, if it has an on and off switch then chances are it can be a part of the IoT. \\xc2\\xa0The analyst firm \\n \\nGartner\\n says that by 2020 there will be over 26 billion connected devices... That\\'s a lot of connections (some even estimate this number to be much higher, over 100 billion). \\xc2\\xa0The IoT is a giant network of connected \"things\" (which also includes people). \\xc2\\xa0The relationship will be between people-people, people-things, and things-things.\\nMost Popular In: LeadershipAnyone Who Doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t Know The Following Facts About Capitalism Should Learn ThemWant To Escape From America? 12 Countries Where You Can Buy Citizenship (And A Second Passport)Why Now Is The Perfect Time To Job HuntHow Does This Impact You?\\nThe new rule for the future is going to be, \"Anything that can be connected, will be connected.\" But why on earth would you want so many connected devices talking to each other? There are many examples for what this might look like or what the potential value might be. Say for example you are on your way to a meeting; your car could have access to your calendar and already know the best route to take. If the traffic is heavy your car might send a text to the other party notifying them that you will be late. What if your alarm clock wakes up you at 6 a.m. and then notifies your coffee maker to start brewing coffee for you? What if your office equipment knew when it was running low on supplies and automatically re-ordered more? \\xc2\\xa0What if the wearable device you used in the workplace could tell you when and where you were most active and productive and shared that information with other devices that you used while working?\\n\\nOn a broader scale, the IoT can be applied to things like transportation networks: \"smart cities\" which can help us reduce waste and improve efficiency for things such as energy use; this helping us understand and improve how we work and live. Take a look at the visual below to see what something like that can look like.\\n\\n\\nThe reality is that the IoT allows for virtually endless opportunities and connections to take place, many of which we can\\'t even think of or fully understand the impact of today. It\\'s not hard to see how and why the IoT is such a hot topic today; it certainly opens the door to a lot of opportunities but also to many challenges. Security is a big issue that is oftentimes brought up. With billions of devices being connected together, what can people do to make sure that their information stays secure? Will someone be able to hack into your toaster and thereby get access to your entire network? The IoT also opens up companies all over the world to more security threats. Then we have the issue of privacy and data sharing. This is a hot-button topic even today, so one can only imagine how the conversation and concerns will escalate when we are talking about many billions of devices being connected. Another issue that many companies specifically are going to be faced with is around the massive amounts of data that all of these devices are going to produce. Companies need to figure out a way to store, track, analyze and make sense of the vast amounts of data that will be generated.\\nSo what now?\\nConversations about the IoT are (and have been for several years) taking place all over the world as we seek to understand how this will impact our lives. We are also trying to understand what the many opportunities and challenges are going to be as more and more devices start to join the IoT. For now the best thing that we can do is educate ourselves about what the IoT is and the potential impacts that can be seen on how we work and live.\\n\\nSubscribe To The Forbes Careers Newsletter\\n \\nSign up here to get top career advice delivered straight to your inbox every week.\\n\\nJacob Morgan is a keynote speaker, author (most recently of The Future of Work), and futurist.Jacob MorganJacob is an Author, speaker and futurist.

On the constructive side,\\nmany of the core formalisms and techniques used in AI come out of, and\\nare indeed still much used and refined in, philosophy: first-order\\nlogic and its extensions; intensional logics suitable for the modeling\\nof doxastic attitudes and deontic reasoning; inductive logic,\\nprobability theory, and probabilistic reasoning; practical reasoning\\nand planning, and so on. In light of this, some philosophers conduct\\nAI research and development as philosophy. \\n\\nIn the present entry, the history of AI is briefly recounted, proposed\\ndefinitions of the field are discussed, and an overview of the field\\nis provided. In addition, both philosophical AI (AI pursued as and out\\nof philosophy) and philosophy of AI are discussed, via\\nexamples of both.

The History of AI\\n\\nThe field of artificial intelligence (AI) officially started in 1956,\\nlaunched by a small but now-famous\\n DARPA-sponsored\\n summer conference at Dartmouth College, in Hanover, New Hampshire.\\n(The 50-year celebration of this conference,\\n AI@50,\\n was held in July 2006 at Dartmouth, with five of the original\\nparticipants making it\\n back.[2]\\n What happened at this historic conference figures in the final\\nsection of this entry.) Ten thinkers attended, including John McCarthy\\n(who was working at Dartmouth in 1956), Claude Shannon, Marvin Minsky,\\nArthur Samuel, Trenchard Moore (apparently the lone note-taker at the\\noriginal conference), Ray Solomonoff, Oliver Selfridge, Allen Newell,\\nand Herbert Simon. From where we stand now, into the start of the new\\nmillennium, the Dartmouth conference is memorable for many reasons,\\nincluding this pair: one, the term \\xe2\\x80\\x98artificial\\nintelligence\\xe2\\x80\\x99 was coined there (and has long been firmly\\nentrenched, despite being disliked by some of the attendees, e.g.,\\nMoore); two, Newell and Simon revealed a program \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Logic\\nTheorist (LT) \\xe2\\x80\\x93 agreed by the attendees (and, indeed, by nearly\\nall those who learned of and about it soon after the conference) to be\\na remarkable achievement. LT was capable of proving elementary\\ntheorems in the propositional\\n calculus.[3][4]\\n\\nThough the term \\xe2\\x80\\x98artificial intelligence\\xe2\\x80\\x99 made\\nits advent at the 1956 conference, certainly the field of AI,\\noperationally defined (defined, i.e., as a field constituted by\\npractitioners who think and act in certain ways), was in operation\\nbefore 1956. For example, in a famous Mind paper of 1950,\\nAlan Turing argues that the question \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan a machine\\nthink?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (and here Turing is talking about standard computing\\nmachines: machines capable of computing functions from the natural\\nnumbers (or pairs, triples, \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 thereof) to the natural numbers\\nthat a Turing machine or equivalent can handle) should be replaced\\nwith the question \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan a machine be linguistically\\nindistinguishable from a human?.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Specifically, he proposes a\\ntest, the\\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTuring Test\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n (TT) as it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s now known. In the TT, a woman and a computer are\\nsequestered in sealed rooms, and a human judge, in the dark as to\\nwhich of the two rooms contains which contestant, asks questions by\\nemail (actually, by teletype, to use the original term) of the\\ntwo. If, on the strength of returned answers, the judge can do no\\nbetter than 50/50 when delivering a verdict as to which room houses\\nwhich player, we say that the computer in question has passed\\nthe TT. Passing in this sense operationalizes linguistic\\nindistinguishability. Later, we shall discuss the role that TT has\\nplayed, and indeed continues to play, in attempts to define AI. At the\\nmoment, though, the point is that in his paper, Turing explicitly lays\\ndown the call for building machines that would provide an existence\\nproof of an affirmative answer to his question. The call even includes\\na suggestion for how such construction should proceed. (He suggests\\nthat \\xe2\\x80\\x9cchild machines\\xe2\\x80\\x9d be built, and that these machines\\ncould then gradually grow up on their own to learn to communicate in\\nnatural language at the level of adult humans. This suggestion has\\narguably been followed by Rodney Brooks and the philosopher Daniel\\nDennett (1994) in the Cog Project. In addition, the Spielberg/Kubrick\\nmovie A.I. is at least in part a cinematic exploration of\\nTuring\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\n suggestion.[5])\\n The TT continues to be at the heart of AI and discussions of its\\nfoundations, as confirmed by the appearance of (Moor 2003). In fact,\\nthe TT continues to be used to define the field, as in\\nNilsson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s (1998) position, expressed in his textbook for the\\nfield, that AI simply is the field devoted to building an artifact\\nable to negotiate this test. Energy supplied by the dream of\\nengineering a computer that can pass TT, or by controversy surrounding\\nclaims that it has already been passed, is if anything\\nstronger than ever, and the reader has only to do an internet search\\nvia the string \\n\\nturing test passed \\n\\nto find up-to-the-minute attempts at reaching this dream, and attempts\\n(sometimes made by philosophers) to debunk claims that some such\\nattempt has succeeded.\\n\\nReturning to the issue of the historical record, even if one bolsters\\nthe claim that AI started at the 1956 conference by adding the proviso\\nthat \\xe2\\x80\\x98artificial intelligence\\xe2\\x80\\x99 refers to a nuts-and-bolts\\nengineering pursuit (in which case Turing\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nphilosophical discussion, despite calls for a child machine,\\nwouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exactly count as AI per se), one must confront the fact\\nthat Turing, and indeed many predecessors, did attempt to build\\nintelligent artifacts. In Turing\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case, such building was\\nsurprisingly well-understood before the advent of programmable\\ncomputers: Turing wrote a program for playing chess before there were\\ncomputers to run such programs on, by slavishly following the code\\nhimself. He did this well before 1950, and long before Newell (1973)\\ngave thought in print to the possibility of a sustained, serious\\nattempt at building a good chess-playing\\n computer.[6]\\n\\nFrom the perspective of philosophy, which views the systematic\\ninvestigation of mechanical intelligence as meaningful and productive\\nseparate from the specific logicist formalisms (e.g., first-order\\nlogic) and problems (e.g., the Entscheidungsproblem) that gave\\nbirth to computer science, neither the 1956 conference, nor\\nTuring\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Mind paper, come close to marking the start of\\nAI. This is easy enough to see. For example, Descartes proposed TT\\n(not the TT by name, of course) long before Turing was\\n born.[7]\\n Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the relevant passage: \\n\\nIf there were machines which bore a resemblance to our body and\\nimitated our actions as far as it was morally possible to do so, we\\nshould always have two very certain tests by which to recognise that,\\nfor all that, they were not real men. The first is, that they could\\nnever use speech or other signs as we do when placing our thoughts on\\nrecord for the benefit of others. For we can easily understand a\\nmachine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being constituted so that it can utter words, and even\\nemit some responses to action on it of a corporeal kind, which brings\\nabout a change in its organs; for instance, if it is touched in a\\nparticular part it may ask what we wish to say to it; if in another\\npart it may exclaim that it is being hurt, and so on. But it never\\nhappens that it arranges its speech in various ways, in order to reply\\nappropriately to everything that may be said in its presence, as even\\nthe lowest type of man can do. And the second difference is, that\\nalthough machines can perform certain things as well as or perhaps\\nbetter than any of us can do, they infallibly fall short in others, by\\nwhich means we may discover that they did not act from knowledge, but\\nonly for the disposition of their organs. For while reason is a\\nuniversal instrument which can serve for all contingencies, these\\norgans have need of some special adaptation for every particular\\naction. From this it follows that it is morally impossible that there\\nshould be sufficient diversity in any machine to allow it to act in\\nall the events of life in the same way as our reason causes us to act.\\n(Descartes 1637, p. 116)\\n\\n\\nAt the moment, Descartes is certainly carrying the\\n day.[8]\\n Turing predicted that his test would be passed by 2000, but the\\nfireworks across the globe at the start of the new millennium have\\nlong since died down, and the most articulate of computers still\\ncan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t meaningfully debate a sharp toddler. Moreover, while in\\ncertain focussed areas machines out-perform minds (IBM\\xe2\\x80\\x99s famous\\nDeep Blue prevailed in chess over Gary Kasparov, e.g.; and more\\nrecently, AI systems have prevailed in other games, e.g.\\nJeopardy! and Go, about which more will momentarily be said),\\nminds have a (Cartesian) capacity for cultivating their expertise in\\nvirtually any sphere. (If it were announced to Deep Blue, or\\nany current successor, that chess was no longer to be the game of\\nchoice, but rather a heretofore unplayed variant of chess, the machine\\nwould be trounced by human children of average intelligence having no\\nchess expertise.) AI simply hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t managed to create\\ngeneral intelligence; it hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even managed to produce\\nan artifact indicating that eventually it will create such a\\nthing. \\n\\nBut what about IBM Watson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s famous nail-biting victory in the\\nJeopardy! game-show\\n contest?[9]\\n That certainly seems to be a machine triumph over humans on their\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9chome field,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d since Jeopardy! delivers a\\nhuman-level linguistic challenge ranging across many domains. Indeed,\\namong many AI cognoscenti, Watson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s success is considered to be\\nmuch more impressive than Deep Blue\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, for numerous reasons. One\\nreason is that while chess is generally considered to be\\nwell-understood from the formal-computational perspective (after all,\\nit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s well-known that there exists a perfect strategy for playing\\nchess), in open-domain question-answering (QA), as in any\\nsignificant natural-language processing task, there is no consensus as\\nto what problem, formally speaking, one is trying to solve. Briefly,\\nquestion-answering (QA) is what the reader would think it is: one asks\\na question of a machine, and gets an answer, where the answer has to\\nbe produced via some \\xe2\\x80\\x9csignificant\\xe2\\x80\\x9d computational process.\\n(See Strzalkowski & Harabagiu (2006) for an overview of what QA,\\nhistorically, has been as a field.) A bit more precisely, there is no\\nagreement as to what underlying function, formally speaking,\\nquestion-answering capability computes. This lack of agreement stems\\nquite naturally from the fact that there is of course no consensus as\\nto what natural languages are, formally\\n speaking.[10]\\n Despite this murkiness, and in the face of an almost universal belief\\nthat open-domain question-answering would remain unsolved for a decade\\nor more, Watson decisively beat the two top human Jeopardy!\\nchampions on the planet. During the contest, Watson had to answer\\nquestions that required not only command of simple factoids\\n(Question1), but also of some amount of rudimentary\\nreasoning (in the form of temporal reasoning) and commonsense\\n(Question2):\\n\\nQuestion1: The only two consecutive U.S. presidents\\nwith the same first name. \\n\\nQuestion2: In May 1898, Portugal celebrated the\\n400th anniversary of this explorer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s arrival in India. \\n\\nWhile Watson is demonstrably better than humans in\\nJeopardy!-style quizzing (a new human Jeopardy! master\\ncould arrive on the scene, but as for chess, AI now assumes that a\\nsecond round of IBM-level investment would vanquish the new human\\nopponent), this approach does not work for the kind of NLP challenge\\nthat Descartes described; that is, Watson can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t converse on the\\nfly. After all, some questions don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hinge on sophisticated\\ninformation retrieval and machine learning over pre-existing data, but\\nrather on intricate reasoning right on the spot. Such questions may\\nfor instance involve anaphora resolution, which require even deeper\\ndegrees of commonsensical understanding of time, space, history, folk\\npsychology, and so on. Levesque (2013) has catalogued some alarmingly\\nsimple questions which fall in this category. (Marcus, 2013, gives an\\naccount of Levesque\\xe2\\x80\\x99s challenges that is accessible to a wider\\naudience.) The other class of question-answering tasks on which Watson\\nfails can be characterized as dynamic question-answering. These\\nare questions for which answers may not be recorded in textual form\\nanywhere at the time of questioning, or for which answers are\\ndependent on factors that change with time. Two questions that fall in\\nthis category are given below (Govindarajulu et al. 2013):\\n\\nQuestion3: If I have 4 foos and 5 bars, and if foos\\nare not the same as bars, how many foos will I have if I get 3 bazes\\nwhich just happen to be foos?\\n\\nQuestion4: What was IBM\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Sharpe ratio in the\\nlast 60 days of trading? \\n\\nClosely following Watson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s victory, in March 2016,\\n Google DeepMind\\xe2\\x80\\x99s AlphaGo\\n defeated one of Go\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top-ranked players, Lee Seedol, in four\\nout of five matches. This was considered a landmark achievement within\\nAI, as it was widely believed in the AI community that computer\\nvictory in Go was at least a few decades away, partly due to the\\nenormous number of valid sequences of moves in Go compared to that in\\n Chess.[11]\\n While this is a remarkable achievement, it should be noted that,\\ndespite breathless coverage in the popular\\n press,[12]\\n AlphaGo, while indisputably a great Go player, is just that. For\\nexample, neither AlphaGo nor Watson can understand the rules of Go\\nwritten in plain-and-simple English and produce a computer program\\nthat can play the game. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interesting that there is one\\nendeavor in AI that tackles a narrow version of this very problem: In\\ngeneral game playing, a machine is given a description of a\\nbrand new game just before it has to play the game (Genesereth et al.\\n2005). However, the description in question is expressed in a formal\\nlanguage, and the machine has to manage to play the game from this\\ndescription. Note that this is still far from understanding even a\\nsimple description of a game in English well enough to play it. \\n\\nBut what if we consider the history of AI not from the perspective of\\nphilosophy, but rather from the perspective of the field with which,\\ntoday, it is most closely connected? The reference here is to computer\\nscience. From this perspective, does AI run back to well before\\nTuring? Interestingly enough, the results are the same: we find that\\nAI runs deep into the past, and has always had philosophy in its\\nveins. This is true for the simple reason that computer science grew\\nout of logic and probability\\n theory,[13]\\n which in turn grew out of (and is still intertwined with) philosophy.\\nComputer science, today, is shot through and through with logic; the\\ntwo fields cannot be separated. This phenomenon has become an object\\nof study unto itself (Halpern et al. 2001). The situation is no\\ndifferent when we are talking not about traditional logic, but rather\\nabout probabilistic formalisms, also a significant component of\\nmodern-day AI: These formalisms also grew out of philosophy, as nicely\\nchronicled, in part, by Glymour (1992). For example, in the one mind\\nof Pascal was born a method of rigorously calculating probabilities,\\nconditional probability (which plays a particularly large role in AI,\\ncurrently), and such fertile philosophico-probabilistic arguments as\\n Pascal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wager,\\n according to which it is irrational not to become a Christian. \\n\\nThat modern-day AI has its roots in philosophy, and in fact that these\\nhistorical roots are temporally deeper than even Descartes\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\ndistant day, can be seen by looking to the clever, revealing cover of\\nthe second edition (the third edition is the current one) of the\\ncomprehensive textbook\\n Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach\\n (known in the AI community as simply AIMA2e for Russell &\\nNorvig, 2002).\\n\\n\\n\\nCover of AIMA2e (Russell & Norvig 2002)\\n\\n\\nWhat you see there is an eclectic collection of memorabilia that might\\nbe on and around the desk of some imaginary AI researcher. For\\nexample, if you look carefully, you will specifically see: a picture\\nof Turing, a view of Big Ben through a window (perhaps R&N are\\naware of the fact that Turing famously held at one point that a\\nphysical machine with the power of a universal Turing machine is\\nphysically impossible: he quipped that it would have to be the size of\\nBig Ben), a planning algorithm described in Aristotle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s De\\nMotu Animalium,\\n Frege\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fascinating notation for first-order logic,\\n a glimpse of Lewis Carroll\\xe2\\x80\\x99s (1958) pictorial representation of\\nsyllogistic reasoning, Ramon Lull\\xe2\\x80\\x99s concept-generating wheel\\nfrom his 13th-century Ars Magna, and a number of\\nother pregnant items (including, in a clever, recursive, and\\nbordering-on-self-congratulatory touch, a copy of AIMA itself).\\nThough there is insufficient space here to make all the historical\\nconnections, we can safely infer from the appearance of these items\\n(and here we of course refer to the ancient ones: Aristotle conceived\\nof planning as information-processing over two-and-a-half millennia\\nback; and in addition, as Glymour (1992) notes, Artistotle can also be\\ncredited with devising the first knowledge-bases and ontologies, two\\ntypes of representation schemes that have long been central to AI)\\nthat AI is indeed very, very old. Even those who insist that AI is at\\nleast in part an artifact-building enterprise must concede that, in\\nlight of these objects, AI is ancient, for it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just\\ntheorizing from the perspective that intelligence is at bottom\\ncomputational that runs back into the remote past of human history:\\nLull\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wheel, for example, marks an attempt to capture\\nintelligence not only in computation, but in a physical artifact that\\nembodies that\\n computation.[14]\\n\\n\\nAIMA has now reached its the third edition, and those interested in\\nthe history of AI, and for that matter the history of philosophy of\\nmind, will not be disappointed by examination of the cover of the\\nthird installment (the cover of the second edition is almost exactly\\nlike the first edition). (All the elements of the cover, separately\\nlisted and annotated, can be found\\n online.)\\n One significant addition to the cover of the third edition is a\\ndrawing of Thomas Bayes; his appearance reflects the recent rise in\\nthe popularity of probabilistic techniques in AI, which we discuss\\nlater.\\n\\nOne final point about the history of AI seems worth making. \\n\\nIt is generally assumed that the birth of modern-day AI in the 1950s\\ncame in large part because of and through the advent of the modern\\nhigh-speed digital computer. This assumption accords with\\ncommon-sense. After all, AI (and, for that matter, to some degree its\\ncousin, cognitive science, particularly computational cognitive\\nmodeling, the sub-field of cognitive science devoted to producing\\ncomputational simulations of human cognition) is aimed at implementing\\nintelligence in a computer, and it stands to reason that such a goal\\nwould be inseparably linked with the advent of such devices. However,\\nthis is only part of the story: the part that reaches back but to\\nTuring and others (e.g., von Neuman) responsible for the first\\nelectronic computers. The other part is that, as already mentioned, AI\\nhas a particularly strong tie, historically speaking, to reasoning\\n(logic-based and, in the need to deal with uncertainty,\\ninductive/probabilistic reasoning). In this story, nicely told by\\nGlymour (1992), a search for an answer to the question \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is\\na proof?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d eventually led to an answer based on Frege\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nversion of first-order logic (FOL): a (finitary) mathematical proof\\nconsists in a series of step-by-step inferences from one formula of\\nfirst-order logic to the next. The obvious extension of this answer\\n(and it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a complete answer, given that lots of classical\\nmathematics, despite conventional wisdom, clearly can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be\\nexpressed in FOL; even the Peano Axioms, to be expressed as a finite\\nset of formulae, require SOL) is to say that not only\\nmathematical thinking, but thinking, period, can be expressed in FOL.\\n(This extension was entertained by many logicians long before the\\nstart of information-processing psychology and cognitive science\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 a fact some cognitive psychologists and cognitive scientists\\noften seem to forget.) Today, logic-based AI is only part of\\nAI, but the point is that this part still lives (with help from logics\\nmuch more powerful, but much more complicated, than FOL), and it can\\nbe traced all the way back to Aristotle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s theory of the\\n syllogism.[15]\\n In the case of uncertain reasoning, the question isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is a proof?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, but rather questions such as\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is it rational to believe, in light of certain\\nobservations and probabilities?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This is a question posed and\\ntackled long before the arrival of digital computers. \\n2. What Exactly is AI?\\n\\nSo far we have been proceeding as if we have a firm and precise grasp\\nof the nature of AI. But what exactly is AI? Philosophers\\narguably know better than anyone that precisely defining a particular\\ndiscipline to the satisfaction of all relevant parties (including\\nthose working in the discipline itself) can be acutely challenging.\\nPhilosophers of science certainly have proposed credible accounts of\\nwhat constitutes at least the general shape and texture of a given\\nfield of science and/or engineering, but what exactly is the\\nagreed-upon definition of physics? What about biology? What, for that\\nmatter, is philosophy, exactly? These are remarkably difficult, maybe\\neven eternally unanswerable, questions, especially if the target is a\\nconsensus definition. Perhaps the most prudent course we can\\nmanage here under obvious space constraints is to present in\\nencapsulated form some proposed definitions of AI. We do\\ninclude a glimpse of recent attempts to define AI in detailed,\\nrigorous fashion (and we suspect that such attempts will be of\\ninterest to philosophers of science, and those interested in this\\nsub-area of philosophy). \\n\\nRussell and Norvig (1995, 2002, 2009), in their aforementioned\\nAIMA text, provide a set of possible answers to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\nis AI?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d question that has considerable currency in the field\\nitself. These answers all assume that AI should be defined in terms of\\nits goals: a candidate definition thus has the form \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAI is the\\nfield that aims at building \\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The answers all fall under\\na quartet of types placed along two dimensions. One dimension is\\nwhether the goal is to match human performance, or, instead, ideal\\nrationality. The other dimension is whether the goal is to build\\nsystems that reason/think, or rather systems that act. The situation\\nis summed up in this table:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHuman-Based\\nIdeal Rationality \\n\\nReasoning-Based:\\n Systems that think like humans. \\n Systems that think rationally. \\n\\nBehavior-Based:\\n Systems that act like humans. \\n Systems that act rationally. \\n\\n\\nFour Possible Goals for AI According to AIMA \\n\\n\\nPlease note that this quartet of possibilities does reflect (at least\\na significant portion of) the relevant literature. For example,\\nphilosopher John Haugeland (1985) falls into the Human/Reasoning\\nquadrant when he says that AI is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe exciting new effort to\\nmake computers think \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 machines with minds, in the\\nfull and literal sense.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (By far, this is the quadrant that most\\npopular narratives affirm and explore. The recent\\n Westworld\\n TV series is a powerful case in point.) Luger and Stubblefield (1993)\\nseem to fall into the Ideal/Act quadrant when they write: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe\\nbranch of computer science that is concerned with the automation of\\nintelligent behavior.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The Human/Act position is occupied most\\nprominently by Turing, whose test is passed only by those systems able\\nto act sufficiently like a human. The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthinking\\nrationally\\xe2\\x80\\x9d position is defended (e.g.) by Winston (1992). While\\nit might not be entirely uncontroversial to assert that the four bins\\ngiven here are exhaustive, such an assertion appears to be quite\\nplausible, even when the literature up to the present moment is\\ncanvassed. \\n\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important to know that the contrast between the focus on\\nsystems that think/reason versus systems that act, while found, as we\\nhave seen, at the heart of the AIMA texts, and at the heart of\\nAI itself, should not be interpreted as implying that AI researchers\\nview their work as falling all and only within one of these two\\ncompartments. Researchers who focus more or less exclusively on\\nknowledge representation and reasoning, are also quite prepared to\\nacknowledge that they are working on (what they take to be) a central\\ncomponent or capability within any one of a family of larger systems\\nspanning the reason/act distinction. The clearest case may come from\\nthe work on planning \\xe2\\x80\\x93 an AI area traditionally making central\\nuse of representation and reasoning. For good or ill, much of this\\nresearch is done in abstraction (in vitro, as opposed to in vivo), but\\nthe researchers involved certainly intend or at least hope that the\\nresults of their work can be embedded into systems that actually do\\nthings, such as, for example, execute the plans. \\n\\nWhat about Russell and Norvig themselves? What is their answer to the\\nWhat is AI? question? They are firmly in the the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cacting\\nrationally\\xe2\\x80\\x9d camp. In fact, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s safe to say both that they\\nare the chief proponents of this answer, and that they have been\\nremarkably successful evangelists. Their extremely influential\\nAIMA series can be viewed as a book-length defense and\\nspecification of the Ideal/Act category. We will look a bit later at\\nhow Russell and Norvig lay out all of AI in terms of intelligent\\nagents, which are systems that act in accordance with various\\nideal standards for rationality. But first let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s look a bit\\ncloser at the view of intelligence underlying the AIMA text. We\\ncan do so by turning to Russell (1997). Here Russell recasts the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is AI?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d question as the question \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is\\nintelligence?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (presumably under the assumption that we have a\\ngood grasp of what an artifact is), and then he identifies\\nintelligence with rationality. More specifically, Russell sees\\nAI as the field devoted to building intelligent agents, which\\nare functions taking as input tuples of percepts from the external\\nenvironment, and producing behavior (actions) on the basis of these\\npercepts. Russell\\xe2\\x80\\x99s overall picture is this one:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Basic Picture Underlying Russell\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Account of\\nIntelligence/Rationality \\n\\n\\nLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unpack this diagram a bit, and take a look, first, at the\\naccount of perfect rationality that can be derived from it. The\\nbehavior of the agent in the environment \\\\(E\\\\) (from a class \\\\(\\\\bE\\\\)\\nof environments) produces a sequence of states or snapshots of that\\nenvironment. A performance measure \\\\(U\\\\) evaluates this sequence;\\nnotice the box labeled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerformance Measure\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the above\\nfigure. We let \\\\(V(f,\\\\bE,U)\\\\) denote the expected utility\\naccording to \\\\(U\\\\) of the agent function \\\\(f\\\\) operating on\\n \\\\(\\\\bE\\\\).[16]\\n Now we identify a perfectly rational agent with the agent function:\\n \\n\\n\\\\[\\\\tag{1}\\\\label{eq1}\\nf_{\\\\opt} = \\\\argmax_f V(f,\\\\bE,U)\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\nAccording to the above equation, a perfectly rational agent can be\\ntaken to be the function \\\\(f_{opt}\\\\) which produces the maximum\\nexpected utility in the environment under consideration. Of course, as\\nRussell points out, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s usually not possible to actually build\\nperfectly rational agents. For example, though it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy enough\\nto specify an algorithm for playing invincible chess, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not\\nfeasible to implement this algorithm. What traditionally happens in AI\\nis that programs that are \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to use Russell\\xe2\\x80\\x99s apt\\nterminology \\xe2\\x80\\x93 calculatively rational are constructed\\ninstead: these are programs that, if executed infinitely fast,\\nwould result in perfectly rational behavior. In the case of chess,\\nthis would mean that we strive to write a program that runs an\\nalgorithm capable, in principle, of finding a flawless move, but we\\nadd features that truncate the search for this move in order to play\\nwithin intervals of digestible duration. \\n\\nRussell himself champions a new brand of intelligence/rationality for\\nAI; he calls this brand bounded optimality. To understand\\nRussell\\xe2\\x80\\x99s view, first we follow him in introducing a\\ndistinction: We say that agents have two components: a program, and a\\nmachine upon which the program runs. We write \\\\(Agent(P, M)\\\\) to\\ndenote the agent function implemented by program \\\\(P\\\\) running on\\nmachine \\\\(M\\\\). Now, let \\\\(\\\\mathcal{P}(M)\\\\) denote the set of all\\nprograms \\\\(P\\\\) that can run on machine \\\\(M\\\\). The bounded\\noptimal program \\\\(P_{\\\\opt,M}\\\\) then is: \\n\\n\\\\[\\nP_{\\\\opt,M}=\\\\argmax_{P\\\\in\\\\mathcal{P}(M)}V(\\\\mathit{Agent}(P,M),\\\\bE,U)\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\nYou can understand this equation in terms of any of the mathematical\\nidealizations for standard computation. For example, machines can be\\nidentified with Turing machines minus instructions (i.e., TMs are here\\nviewed architecturally only: as having tapes divided into squares upon\\nwhich symbols can be written, read/write heads capable of moving up\\nand down the tape to write and erase, and control units which are in\\none of a finite number of states at any time), and programs can be\\nidentified with instructions in the Turing-machine model (telling the\\nmachine to write and erase symbols, depending upon what state the\\nmachine is in). So, if you are told that you must\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cprogram\\xe2\\x80\\x9d within the constraints of a 22-state Turing\\nmachine, you could search for the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbest\\xe2\\x80\\x9d program given\\nthose constraints. In other words, you could strive to find the\\noptimal program within the bounds of the 22-state architecture.\\nRussell\\xe2\\x80\\x99s (1997) view is thus that AI is the field devoted to\\ncreating optimal programs for intelligent agents, under time and space\\nconstraints on the machines implementing these\\n programs.[17]\\n\\n\\nThe reader must have noticed that in the equation for \\\\(P_{\\\\opt,M}\\\\)\\nwe have not elaborated on \\\\(\\\\bE\\\\) and \\\\(U\\\\) and how equation\\n\\\\eqref{eq1} might be used to construct an agent if the class of\\nenvironments \\\\(\\\\bE\\\\) is quite general, or if the true environment\\n\\\\(E\\\\) is simply unknown. Depending on the task for which one is\\nconstructing an artificial agent, \\\\(E\\\\) and \\\\(U\\\\) would vary. The\\nmathematical form of the environment \\\\(E\\\\) and the utility function\\n\\\\(U\\\\) would vary wildly from, say, chess to Jeopardy!. Of\\ncourse, if we were to design a globally intelligent agent, and not\\njust a chess-playing agent, we could get away with having just one\\npair of \\\\(E\\\\) and \\\\(U\\\\). What would \\\\(E\\\\) look like if we were\\nbuilding a generally intelligent agent and not just an agent that is\\ngood at a single task? \\\\(E\\\\) would be a model of not just a single\\ngame or a task, but the entire physical-social-virtual universe\\nconsisting of many games, tasks, situations, problems, etc. This\\nproject is (at least currently) hopelessly difficult as, obviously, we\\nare nowhere near to having such a comprehensive theory-of-everything\\nmodel. For further discussion of a theoretical architecture put\\nforward for this problem, see the\\n Supplement on the AIXI architecture.\\n \\n\\nIt should be mentioned that there is a different, much more\\nstraightforward answer to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is AI?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d question. This\\nanswer, which goes back to the days of the original Dartmouth\\nconference, was expressed by, among others, Newell (1973), one of the\\ngrandfathers of modern-day AI (recall that he attended the 1956\\nconference); it is: \\n\\nAI is the field devoted to building artifacts that are intelligent,\\nwhere \\xe2\\x80\\x98intelligent\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is operationalized through\\nintelligence tests (such as the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale),\\nand other tests of mental ability (including, e.g., tests of\\nmechanical ability, creativity, and so on).\\n\\n\\nThe above definition can be seen as fully specifying a concrete\\nversion of Russell and Norvig\\xe2\\x80\\x99s four possible goals. Though few\\nare aware of this now, this answer was taken quite seriously for a\\nwhile, and in fact underlied one of the most famous programs in the\\nhistory of AI: the ANALOGY program of Evans (1968), which solved\\ngeometric analogy problems of a type seen in many intelligence tests.\\nAn attempt to rigorously define this forgotten form of AI (as what\\nthey dub Psychometric AI), and to resurrect it from the days of\\nNewell and Evans, is provided by Bringsjord and Schimanski (2003) [see\\nalso e.g. (Bringsjord 2011)]. A sizable private investment has been\\nmade in the ongoing attempt, now known as\\n Project Aristo,\\n to build a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdigital Aristotle\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, in the form of a machine\\nable to excel on standardized tests such at the AP exams tackled by US\\nhigh school students (Friedland et al. 2004). (Vibrant work in this\\ndirection continues today at the\\n Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence.)[18]\\n In addition, researchers at Northwestern have forged a connection\\nbetween AI and tests of mechanical ability (Klenk et al. 2005). \\n\\nIn the end, as is the case with any discipline, to really know\\nprecisely what that discipline is requires you to, at least to some\\ndegree, dive in and do, or at least dive in and read. Two decades ago\\nsuch a dive was quite manageable. Today, because the content that has\\ncome to constitute AI has mushroomed, the dive (or at least the swim\\nafter it) is a bit more demanding.\\n3. Approaches to AI\\n\\nThere are a number of ways of \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccarving up\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AI. By far the\\nmost prudent and productive way to summarize the field is to turn yet\\nagain to the AIMA text given its comprehensive overview of the\\nfield. \\n3.1 The Intelligent Agent Continuum\\n\\nAs Russell and Norvig (2009) tell us in the Preface of AIMA:\\n\\n\\nThe main unifying theme is the idea of an intelligent agent. We define\\nAI as the study of agents that receive percepts from the environment\\nand perform actions. Each such agent implements a function that maps\\npercept sequences to actions, and we cover different ways to represent\\nthese functions\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 (Russell & Norvig 2009, vii)\\n\\n\\nThe basic picture is thus summed up in this figure:\\n\\n\\n\\nImpressionistic Overview of an Intelligent Agent\\n\\n\\nThe content of AIMA derives, essentially, from fleshing out\\nthis picture; that is, the above figure corresponds to the different\\nways of representing the overall function that intelligent agents\\nimplement. And there is a progression from the least powerful agents\\nup to the more powerful ones. The following figure gives a high-level\\nview of a simple kind of agent discussed early in the book. (Though\\nsimple, this sort of agent corresponds to the architecture of\\nrepresentation-free agents designed and implemented by Rodney Brooks,\\n1991.)\\n\\n\\n\\nA Simple Reflex Agent\\n\\n\\nAs the book progresses, agents get increasingly sophisticated, and the\\nimplementation of the function they represent thus draws from more and\\nmore of what AI can currently muster. The following figure gives an\\noverview of an agent that is a bit smarter than the simple reflex\\nagent. This smarter agent has the ability to internally model the\\noutside world, and is therefore not simply at the mercy of what can at\\nthe moment be directly sensed.\\n\\n\\n\\nA More Sophisticated Reflex Agent\\n\\n\\nThere are seven parts to AIMA. As the reader passes through\\nthese parts, she is introduced to agents that take on the powers\\ndiscussed in each part. Part I is an introduction to the agent-based\\nview. Part II is concerned with giving an intelligent agent the\\ncapacity to think ahead a few steps in clearly defined environments.\\nExamples here include agents able to successfully play games of\\nperfect information, such as chess. Part III deals with agents that\\nhave declarative knowledge and can reason in ways that will be quite\\nfamiliar to most philosophers and logicians (e.g., knowledge-based\\nagents deduce what actions should be taken to secure their goals).\\nPart IV of the book outfits agents with the power to handle\\nuncertainty by reasoning in probabilistic\\n fashion.[19]\\n In Part V, agents are given a capacity to learn. The following figure\\nshows the overall structure of a learning agent.\\n\\n\\n\\nA Learning Agent\\n\\n\\nThe final set of powers agents are given allow them to communicate.\\nThese powers are covered in Part VI. \\n\\nPhilosophers who patiently travel the entire progression of\\nincreasingly smart agents will no doubt ask, when reaching the end of\\nPart VII, if anything is missing. Are we given enough, in general, to\\nbuild an artificial person, or is there enough only to build a mere\\nanimal? This question is implicit in the following from Charniak and\\nMcDermott (1985): \\n\\nThe ultimate goal of AI (which we are very far from achieving) is to\\nbuild a person, or, more humbly, an animal. (Charniak & McDermott\\n1985, 7)\\n\\n\\nTo their credit, Russell & Norvig, in AIMA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Chapter\\n27, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAI: Present and Future,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d consider this question, at\\nleast to some\\n degree.[]\\n They do so by considering some challenges to AI that have hitherto\\nnot been met. One of these challenges is described by R&N as\\nfollows: \\n\\n[M]achine learning has made very little progress on the important\\nproblem of constructing new representations at levels of abstraction\\nhigher than the input vocabulary. In computer vision, for example,\\nlearning complex concepts such as Classroom and Cafeteria would be\\nmade unnecessarily difficult if the agent were forced to work from\\npixels as the input representation; instead, the agent needs to be\\nable to form intermediate concepts first, such as Desk and Tray,\\nwithout explicit human supervision. Similar concepts apply to learning\\nbehavior: HavingACupOfTea is a very important high-level step\\nin many plans, but how does it get into an action library that\\ninitially contains much simpler actions such as RaiseArm and Swallow?\\nPerhaps this will incorporate deep belief networks \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nBayesian networks that have multiple layers of hidden variables, as in\\nthe work of Hinton et al. (2006), Hawkins and Blakeslee (2004),\\nand Bengio and LeCun (2007). \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Unless we understand such\\nissues, we are faced with the daunting task of constructing large\\ncommonsense knowledge bases by hand, and approach that has not fared\\nwell to date. (Russell & Norvig 2009, Ch. 27.1)\\n\\n\\nWhile there has seen some advances in addressing this challenge (in\\nthe form of deep learning or representation learning),\\nthis specific challenge is actually merely a foothill before a range\\nof dizzyingly high mountains that AI must eventually somehow manage to\\nclimb. One of those mountains, put simply, is\\n reading.[21]\\n Despite the fact that, as noted, Part V of AIMA is devoted to\\nmachine learning, AI, as it stands, offers next to nothing in the way\\nof a mechanization of learning by reading. Yet when you think about\\nit, reading is probably the dominant way you learn at this stage in\\nyour life. Consider what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing at this very moment.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good bet that you are reading this sentence because,\\nearlier, you set yourself the goal of learning about the field of AI.\\n Yet\\n the formal models of learning provided in AIMA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Part IV\\n(which are all and only the models at play in AI) cannot be applied to\\nlearning by\\n reading.[22]\\n These models all start with a function-based view of learning.\\nAccording to this view, to learn is almost invariably to produce an\\nunderlying function \\\\(\\\\ff\\\\) on the basis of a restricted set of\\npairs \\n\\n\\\\[\\n \\\\left\\\\{\\\\left\\\\langle x_1, \\\\ff(x_1)\\\\right\\\\rangle,\\\\left\\\\langle x_2, \\\\ff(x_2)\\\\right\\\\rangle, \\\\ldots, \\\\left\\\\langle x_n, \\\\ff(x_n)\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\right\\\\}.\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\nFor example, consider receiving inputs consisting of 1, 2, 3, 4, and\\n5, and corresponding range values of 1, 4, 9, 16, and 25; the goal is\\nto \\xe2\\x80\\x9clearn\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the underlying mapping from natural numbers to\\nnatural numbers. In this case, assume that the underlying function is\\n\\\\(n^2\\\\), and that you do \\xe2\\x80\\x9clearn\\xe2\\x80\\x9d it. While this narrow\\nmodel of learning can be productively applied to a number of\\nprocesses, the process of reading isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t one of them. Learning by\\nreading cannot (at least for the foreseeable future) be modeled as\\ndivining a function that produces argument-value pairs. Instead, your\\nreading about AI can pay dividends only if your knowledge has\\nincreased in the right way, and if that knowledge leaves you\\npoised to be able to produce behavior taken to confirm sufficient\\nmastery of the subject area in question. This behavior can range from\\ncorrectly answering and justifying test questions regarding AI, to\\nproducing a robust, compelling presentation or paper that signals your\\nachievement. \\n\\nTwo points deserve to be made about machine reading. First, it may not\\nbe clear to all readers that reading is an ability that is central to\\nintelligence. The centrality derives from the fact that intelligence\\nrequires vast knowledge. We have no other means of getting systematic\\nknowledge into a system than to get it in from text, whether text on\\nthe web, text in libraries, newspapers, and so on. You might even say\\nthat the big problem with AI has been that machines really don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nknow much compared to humans. That can only be because of the fact\\nthat humans read (or hear: illiterate people can listen to text being\\nuttered and learn that way). Either machines gain knowledge by humans\\nmanually encoding and inserting knowledge, or by reading and\\nlistening. These are brute facts. (We leave aside supernatural\\ntechniques, of course. Oddly enough, Turing didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t: he seemed to\\nthink ESP should be discussed in connection with the powers of minds\\nand machines. See Turing,\\n 1950.)[23]\\n\\nNow for the second point. Humans able to read have invariably also\\nlearned a language, and learning languages has been modeled in\\nconformity to the function-based approach adumbrated just above\\n(Osherson et al. 1986). However, this doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t entail that an\\nartificial agent able to read, at least to a significant degree, must\\nhave really and truly learned a natural language. AI is first and\\nforemost concerned with engineering computational artifacts that\\nmeasure up to some test (where, yes, sometimes that test is from the\\nhuman sphere), not with whether these artifacts process information in\\nways that match those present in the human case. It may or may not be\\nnecessary, when engineering a machine that can read, to imbue that\\nmachine with human-level linguistic competence. The issue is\\nempirical, and as time unfolds, and the engineering is pursued, we\\nshall no doubt see the issue settled. \\n\\nTwo additional high mountains facing AI are subjective consciousness\\nand creativity, yet it would seem that these great challenges are ones\\nthe field apparently hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even come to grips with. Mental\\nphenomena of paramount importance to many philosophers of mind and\\nneuroscience are simply missing from AIMA. For example,\\nconsciousness is only mentioned in passing in AIMA, but\\nsubjective consciousness is the most important thing in our lives\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 indeed we only desire to go on living because we wish to go on\\nenjoying subjective states of certain types. Moreover, if human minds\\nare the product of evolution, then presumably phenomenal consciousness\\nhas great survival value, and would be of tremendous help to a robot\\nintended to have at least the behavioral repertoire of the first\\ncreatures with brains that match our own (hunter-gatherers; see Pinker\\n1997). Of course, subjective consciousness is largely missing from the\\nsister fields of cognitive psychology and computational cognitive\\nmodeling as well. We discuss some of these challenges in the\\n Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence\\n section below. For a list of similar challenges to cognitive science,\\nsee the relevant\\n section of the entry on cognitive science.[24]\\n\\n\\nTo some readers, it might seem in the very least tendentious to point\\nto subjective consciousness as a major challenge to AI that it has yet\\nto address. These readers might be of the view that pointing to this\\nproblem is to look at AI through a distinctively philosophical prism,\\nand indeed a controversial philosophical standpoint. \\n\\nBut as its literature makes clear, AI measures itself by looking to\\nanimals and humans and picking out in them remarkable mental powers,\\nand by then seeing if these powers can be mechanized. Arguably the\\npower most important to humans (the capacity to experience) is nowhere\\nto be found on the target list of most AI researchers. There may be a\\ngood reason for this (no formalism is at hand, perhaps), but there is\\nno denying the state of affairs in question obtains, and that, in\\nlight of how AI measures itself, that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worrisome. \\n\\nAs to creativity, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s quite remarkable that the power we most\\npraise in human minds is nowhere to be found in AIMA. Just as\\nin (Charniak & McDermott 1985) one cannot find\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98neural\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in the index, \\xe2\\x80\\x98creativity\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\ncan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be found in the index of AIMA. This is particularly\\nodd because many AI researchers have in fact worked on creativity\\n(especially those coming out of philosophy; e.g., Boden 1994,\\nBringsjord & Ferrucci 2000). \\n\\nAlthough the focus has been on AIMA, any of its counterparts\\ncould have been used. As an example, consider Artificial\\nIntelligence: A New Synthesis, by Nils Nilsson. As in the case of\\nAIMA, everything here revolves around a gradual progression\\nfrom the simplest of agents (in Nilsson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case, reactive\\nagents), to ones having more and more of those powers that\\ndistinguish persons. Energetic readers can verify that there is a\\nstriking parallel between the main sections of Nilsson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s book\\nand AIMA. In addition, Nilsson, like Russell and Norvig,\\nignores phenomenal consciousness, reading, and creativity. None of the\\nthree are even mentioned. Likewise, a recent comprehensive AI textbook\\nby Luger (2008) follows the same pattern. \\n\\nA final point to wrap up this section. It seems quite plausible to\\nhold that there is a certain inevitability to the structure of an AI\\ntextbook, and the apparent reason is perhaps rather interesting. In\\npersonal conversation, Jim Hendler, a well-known AI researcher who is\\none of the main innovators behind Semantic Web (Berners-Lee, Hendler,\\nLassila 2001), an under-development \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAI-ready\\xe2\\x80\\x9d version of\\nthe World Wide Web, has said that this inevitability can be rather\\neasily displayed when teaching Introduction to AI; here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how.\\nBegin by asking students what they think AI is. Invariably, many\\nstudents will volunteer that AI is the field devoted to building\\nartificial creatures that are intelligent. Next, ask for examples of\\nintelligent creatures. Students always respond by giving examples\\nacross a continuum: simple multi-cellular organisms, insects, rodents,\\nlower mammals, higher mammals (culminating in the great apes), and\\nfinally human persons. When students are asked to describe the\\ndifferences between the creatures they have cited, they end up\\nessentially describing the progression from simple agents to ones\\nhaving our (e.g.) communicative powers. This progression gives the\\nskeleton of every comprehensive AI textbook. Why does this happen? The\\nanswer seems clear: it happens because we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t resist\\nconceiving of AI in terms of the powers of extant creatures with which\\nwe are familiar. At least at present, persons, and the creatures who\\nenjoy only bits and pieces of personhood, are \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to repeat\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 the measure of\\n AI.[25]\\n\\n3.2 Logic-Based AI: Some Surgical Points\\n\\nReasoning based on classical deductive logic is monotonic; that is, if\\n\\\\(\\\\Phi\\\\vdash\\\\phi\\\\), then for all \\\\(\\\\psi\\\\), \\\\(\\\\Phi\\\\cup\\n\\\\{\\\\psi\\\\}\\\\vdash\\\\phi\\\\). Commonsense reasoning is not monotonic. While\\nyou may currently believe on the basis of reasoning that your house is\\nstill standing, if while at work you see on your computer screen that\\na vast tornado is moving through the location of your house, you will\\ndrop this belief. The addition of new information causes previous\\ninferences to fail. In the simpler example that has become an AI\\nstaple, if I tell you that Tweety is a bird, you will infer that\\nTweety can fly, but if I then inform you that Tweety is a penguin, the\\ninference evaporates, as well it should. Nonmonotonic (or defeasible)\\nlogic includes formalisms designed to capture the mechanisms\\nunderlying these kinds of examples. See the separate entry on\\n logic and artificial intelligence,\\n which is focused on nonmonotonic reasoning, and reasoning about time\\nand change. It also provides a history of the early days of\\nlogic-based AI, making clear the contributions of those who founded\\nthe tradition (e.g., John McCarthy and Pat Hayes; see their seminal\\n1969 paper). \\n\\nThe formalisms and techniques of logic-based AI have reached a level\\nof impressive maturity \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so much so that in various academic and\\ncorporate laboratories, implementations of these formalisms and\\ntechniques can be used to engineer robust, real-world software. It is\\nstrongly recommend that readers who have an interest to learn where AI\\nstands in these areas consult (Mueller 2006), which provides, in one\\nvolume, integrated coverage of nonmonotonic reasoning (in the form,\\nspecifically, of circumscription), and reasoning about time and change\\nin the situation and event calculi. (The former calculus is also\\nintroduced by Thomason. In the second, timepoints are included, among\\nother things.) The other nice thing about (Mueller 2006) is that the\\nlogic used is multi-sorted first-order logic (MSL), which has\\nunificatory power that will be known to and appreciated by many\\ntechnical philosophers and logicians (Manzano 1996). \\n\\nWe now turn to three further topics of importance in AI. They are:\\n\\n The overarching scheme of logicist AI, in the context of the\\nattempt to build intelligent artificial agents. \\n Common Logic and the intensifying quest for interoperability.\\n\\n A technique that can be called encoding down, which can\\nallow machines to reason efficiently over knowledge that, were it not\\nencoded down, would, when reasoned over, lead to paralyzing\\ninefficiency. \\n\\n\\nThis trio is covered in order, beginning with the first.\\n\\nDetailed accounts of logicist AI that fall under the agent-based\\nscheme can be found in (Nilsson 1991, Bringsjord & Ferrucci\\n 1998).[26].\\n The core idea is that an intelligent agent receives percepts from the\\nexternal world in the form of formulae in some logical system (e.g.,\\nfirst-order logic), and infers, on the basis of these percepts and its\\nknowledge base, what actions should be performed to secure the\\nagent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s goals. (This is of course a barbaric simplification.\\nInformation from the external world is encoded in formulae,\\nand transducers to accomplish this feat may be components of the\\nagent.) \\n\\nTo clarify things a bit, we consider, briefly, the logicist view in\\nconnection with arbitrary logical systems\\n \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}_{X}\\\\).[27]\\n We obtain a particular logical system by setting \\\\(X\\\\) in the\\nappropriate way. Some examples: If \\\\(X=I\\\\), then we have a system at\\nthe level of FOL [following the standard notation from model theory;\\nsee e.g. (Ebbinghaus et al. 1984)]. \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}_{II}\\\\) is\\nsecond-order logic, and \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\omega_I\\\\omega}\\\\) is a\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9csmall system\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of infinitary logic (countably infinite\\nconjunctions and disjunctions are permitted). These logical systems\\nare all extensional, but there are intensional ones as\\nwell. For example, we can have logical systems corresponding to those\\nseen in standard propositional modal logic (Chellas 1980). One\\npossibility, familiar to many philosophers, would be propositional\\nKT45, or\\n \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}_{KT45}\\\\).[28]\\n In each case, the system in question includes a relevant alphabet\\nfrom which well-formed formulae are constructed by way of a formal\\ngrammar, a reasoning (or proof) theory, a formal semantics, and at\\nleast some meta-theoretical results (soundness, completeness, etc.).\\nTaking off from standard notation, we can thus say that a set of\\nformulas in some particular logical system \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}_X\\\\),\\n\\\\(\\\\Phi_{\\\\mathcal{L}_X}\\\\), can be used, in conjunction with some\\nreasoning theory, to infer some particular formula\\n\\\\(\\\\phi_{\\\\mathcal{L}_X}\\\\). (The reasoning may be deductive, inductive,\\nabductive, and so on. Logicist AI isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t in the least restricted\\nto any particular mode of reasoning.) To say that such a situation\\nholds, we write \\n\\n    \\\\[\\n    \\\\Phi_{\\\\mathcal{L}_X} \\\\vdash_{\\\\mathcal{L}_X} \\\\phi_{\\\\mathcal{L}_X}\\n    \\\\]\\n\\n \\n\\nWhen the logical system referred to is clear from context, or when we\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care about which logical system is involved, we can simply\\nwrite \\n\\n    \\\\[\\n    \\\\Phi \\\\vdash \\\\phi\\n    \\\\]\\n\\n \\n\\nEach logical system, in its formal semantics, will include objects\\ndesigned to represent ways the world pointed to by formulae in this\\nsystem can be. Let these ways be denoted by \\\\(W^i_{{\\\\mathcal{L}_X}}\\\\).\\nWhen we aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t concerned with which logical system is involved,\\nwe can simply write \\\\(W^i\\\\). To say that such a way models a formula\\n\\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) we write \\n\\n    \\\\[\\n    W_i \\\\models \\\\phi\\n    \\\\]\\n\\n \\n\\nWe extend this to a set of formulas in the natural way:\\n\\\\(W^i\\\\models\\\\Phi\\\\) means that all the elements of \\\\(\\\\Phi\\\\) are true on\\n\\\\(W^i\\\\). Now, using the simple machinery we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve established, we\\ncan describe, in broad strokes, the life of an intelligent agent that\\nconforms to the logicist point of view. This life conforms to the\\nbasic cycle that undergirds intelligent agents in the AIMA\\nsense. \\n\\nTo begin, we assume that the human designer, after studying the world,\\nuses the language of a particular logical system to give to our agent\\nan initial set of beliefs \\\\(\\\\Delta_0\\\\) about what this world is like.\\nIn doing so, the designer works with a formal model of this world,\\n\\\\(W\\\\), and ensures that \\\\(W\\\\models\\\\Delta_0\\\\). Following tradition, we\\nrefer to \\\\(\\\\Delta_0\\\\) as the agent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s (starting) knowledge\\nbase. (This terminology, given that we are talking about the\\nagent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s beliefs, is known to be peculiar, but it\\npersists.) Next, the agent ADJUSTS its knowlege base to produce\\na new one, \\\\(\\\\Delta_1\\\\). We say that adjustment is carried out by way\\nof an operation \\\\(\\\\mathcal{A}\\\\); so\\n\\\\(\\\\mathcal{A}[\\\\Delta_0]=\\\\Delta_1\\\\). How does the adjustment process,\\n\\\\(\\\\mathcal{A}\\\\), work? There are many possibilities. Unfortunately,\\nmany believe that the simplest possibility (viz.,\\n\\\\(\\\\mathcal{A}[\\\\Delta_i]\\\\) equals the set of all formulas that can be\\ndeduced in some elementary manner from \\\\(\\\\Delta_i\\\\)) exhausts\\nall the possibilities. The reality is that adjustment, as\\nindicated above, can come by way of any mode of reasoning\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 induction, abduction, and yes, various forms of deduction\\ncorresponding to the logical system in play. For present purposes,\\nit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not important that we carefully enumerate all the options.\\n\\n\\nThe cycle continues when the agent ACTS on the environment, in\\nan attempt to secure its goals. Acting, of course, can cause changes\\nto the environment. At this point, the agent SENSES the\\nenvironment, and this new information \\\\(\\\\Gamma_1\\\\) factors into the\\nprocess of adjustment, so that\\n\\\\(\\\\mathcal{A}[\\\\Delta_1\\\\cup\\\\Gamma_1]=\\\\Delta_2\\\\). The cycle of SENSES\\n\\\\(\\\\Rightarrow\\\\) ADJUSTS \\\\(\\\\Rightarrow\\\\) ACTS continues to produce\\nthe life \\\\(\\\\Delta_0,\\\\Delta_1,\\\\Delta_2,\\\\Delta_3,\\\\ldots,\\\\) \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 of\\nour agent. \\n\\nIt may strike you as preposterous that logicist AI be touted as an\\napproach taken to replicate all of cognition. Reasoning over\\nformulae in some logical system might be appropriate for\\ncomputationally capturing high-level tasks like trying to solve a math\\nproblem (or devising an outline for an entry in the Stanford\\nEncyclopedia of Philosophy), but how could such reasoning apply to\\ntasks like those a hawk tackles when swooping down to capture\\nscurrying prey? In the human sphere, the task successfully negotiated\\nby athletes would seem to be in the same category. Surely, some will\\ndeclare, an outfielder chasing down a fly ball doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t prove\\ntheorems to figure out how to pull off a diving catch to save the\\ngame! Two brutally reductionistic arguments can be given in support of\\nthis \\xe2\\x80\\x9clogicist theory of everything\\xe2\\x80\\x9d approach towards\\ncognition. The first stems from the fact that a complete proof\\ncalculus for just first-order logic can simulate all of Turing-level\\ncomputation (Chapter 11, Boolos et al. 2007). The second justification\\ncomes from the role logic plays in foundational theories of\\nmathematics and mathematical reasoning. Not only are foundational\\ntheories of mathematics cast in logic (Potter 2004), but there have\\nbeen successful projects resulting in machine verification of ordinary\\nnon-trivial theorems, e.g., in the\\n Mizar project\\n alone around 50,000 theorems have been verified (Naumowicz and\\nKornilowicz 2009). The argument goes that if any approach to AI can be\\ncast mathematically, then it can be cast in a logicist form. \\n\\nNeedless to say, such a declaration has been carefully considered by\\nlogicists beyond the reductionistic argument given above. For example,\\nRosenschein and Kaelbling (1986) describe a method in which logic is\\nused to specify finite state machines. These machines are used at\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9crun time\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for rapid, reactive processing. In this\\napproach, though the finite state machines contain no logic in the\\ntraditional sense, they are produced by logic and inference. Real\\nrobot control via first-order theorem proving has been demonstrated by\\nAmir and Maynard-Reid (1999, 2000, 2001). In fact, you can\\n download\\n version 2.0 of the software that makes this approach real for a Nomad\\n200 mobile robot in an office environment. Of course, negotiating an\\noffice environment is a far cry from the rapid adjustments an\\noutfielder for the Yankees routinely puts on display, but certainly\\nit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an open question as to whether future machines will be able\\nto mimic such feats through rapid reasoning. The question is open if\\nfor no other reason than that all must concede that the constant\\nincrease in reasoning speed of first-order theorem provers is\\nbreathtaking. (For up-to-date news on this increase, visit and monitor\\nthe\\n TPTP site.)\\n There is no known reason why the software engineering in question\\ncannot continue to produce speed gains that would eventually allow an\\nartificial creature to catch a fly ball by processing information in\\npurely logicist fashion. \\n\\nNow we come to the second topic related to logicist AI that warrants\\nmention herein: common logic and the intensifying quest for\\ninteroperability between logic-based systems using different logics.\\nOnly a few brief comments are\\n offered.[29]\\n Readers wanting more can explore the links provided in the course of\\nthe summary. \\n\\nOne standardization is through what is known as\\n Common Logic\\n (CL), and variants thereof. (CL is published as an\\n ISO standard\\n \\xe2\\x80\\x93 ISO is the International Standards Organization.)\\nPhilosophers interested in logic, and of course logicians, will find\\nCL to be quite fascinating. From an historical perspective, the advent\\nof CL is interesting in no small part because the person spearheading\\nit is none other than Pat Hayes, the same Hayes who, as we have seen,\\nworked with McCarthy to establish logicist AI in the 1960s. Though\\nHayes was not at the original 1956 Dartmouth conference, he certainly\\nmust be regarded as one of the founders of contemporary AI.) One of\\nthe interesting things about CL, at least as we see it, is that it\\nsignifies a trend toward the marriage of logics, and programming\\nlanguages and environments. Another system that is a logic/programming\\nhybrid is\\n Athena,\\n which can be used as a programming language, and is at the same time\\na form of MSL. Athena is based on formal systems known as\\ndenotational proof languages (Arkoudas 2000). \\n\\nHow is interoperability between two systems to be enabled by CL?\\nSuppose one of these systems is based on logic \\\\(L\\\\), and the other on\\n\\\\(L'\\\\). (To ease exposition, assume that both logics are first-order.)\\nThe idea is that a theory \\\\(\\\\Phi_L\\\\), that is, a set of formulae in\\n\\\\(L\\\\), can be translated into CL, producing \\\\(\\\\Phi_{CL}\\\\), and then\\nthis theory can be translated into \\\\(\\\\Phi_L'\\\\). CL thus becomes an\\ninter lingua. Note that what counts as a well-formed formula in\\n\\\\(L\\\\) can be different than what counts as one in \\\\(L'\\\\). The two\\nlogics might also have different proof theories. For example,\\ninference in \\\\(L\\\\) might be based on resolution, while inference in\\n\\\\(L'\\\\) is of the natural deduction variety. Finally, the symbol sets\\nwill be different. Despite these differences, courtesy of the\\ntranslations, desired behavior can be produced across the translation.\\nThat, at any rate, is the hope. The technical challenges here are\\nimmense, but federal monies are increasingly available for attacks on\\nthe problem of interoperability.\\n\\nNow for the third topic in this section: what can be called\\nencoding down. The technique is easy to understand. Suppose\\nthat we have on hand a set \\\\(\\\\Phi\\\\) of first-order axioms. As is\\nwell-known, the problem of deciding, for arbitrary formula \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\),\\nwhether or not it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s deducible from \\\\(\\\\Phi\\\\) is\\nTuring-undecidable: there is no Turing machine or equivalent that can\\ncorrectly return \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the general\\ncase. However, if the domain in question is finite, we can encode this\\nproblem down to the propositional calculus. An assertion that all\\nthings have \\\\(F\\\\) is of course equivalent to the assertion that\\n\\\\(Fa\\\\), \\\\(Fb\\\\), \\\\(Fc\\\\), as long as the domain contains only these\\nthree objects. So here a first-order quantified formula becomes a\\nconjunction in the propositional calculus. Determining whether such\\nconjunctions are provable from axioms themselves expressed in the\\npropositional calculus is Turing-decidable, and in addition, in\\ncertain clusters of cases, the check can be done very quickly in the\\npropositional case; very quickly. Readers interested in\\nencoding down to the propositional calculus should consult recent\\n DARPA-sponsored work by Bart Selman.\\n Please note that the target of encoding down doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to be\\nthe propositional calculus. Because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s generally harder for\\nmachines to find proofs in an intensional logic than in straight\\nfirst-order logic, it is often expedient to encode down the former to\\nthe latter. For example, propositional modal logic can be encoded in\\nmulti-sorted logic (a variant of FOL); see (Arkoudas & Bringsjord\\n2005). Prominent usage of such an encoding down can be found in a set\\nof systems known as Description Logics, which are a set of\\nlogics less expressive than first-order logic but more expressive than\\npropositional logic (Baader et al. 2003). Description logics are used\\nto reason about ontologies in a given domain and have been\\nsuccessfully used, for example, in the biomedical domain (Smith et al.\\n2007). \\n3.3 Non-Logicist AI: A Summary\\n\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tempting to define non-logicist AI by negation: an approach\\nto building intelligent agents that rejects the distinguishing\\nfeatures of logicist AI. Such a shortcut would imply that the agents\\nengineered by non-logicist AI researchers and developers, whatever the\\nvirtues of such agents might be, cannot be said to know that \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\);\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 for the simple reason that, by negation, the non-logicist\\nparadigm would have not even a single declarative proposition that is\\na candidate for \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\);. However, this isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a particularly\\nenlightening way to define non-symbolic AI. A more productive approach\\nis to say that non-symbolic AI is AI carried out on the basis of\\nparticular formalisms other than logical systems, and to then\\nenumerate those formalisms. It will turn out, of course, that these\\nformalisms fail to include knowledge in the normal sense. (In\\nphilosophy, as is well-known, the normal sense is one according to\\nwhich if \\\\(p\\\\) is known, \\\\(p\\\\) is a declarative statement.) \\n\\nFrom the standpoint of formalisms other than logical systems,\\nnon-logicist AI can be partitioned into symbolic but non-logicist\\napproaches, and connectionist/neurocomputational approaches. (AI\\ncarried out on the basis of symbolic, declarative structures that, for\\nreadability and ease of use, are not treated directly by researchers\\nas elements of formal logics, does not count. In this category fall\\ntraditional semantic networks, Schank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s (1972) conceptual\\ndependency scheme, frame-based schemes, and other such schemes.) The\\nformer approaches, today, are probabilistic, and are based on the\\nformalisms (Bayesian networks) covered\\n below.\\n The latter approaches are based, as we have noted, on formalisms that\\ncan be broadly termed \\xe2\\x80\\x9cneurocomputational.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Given our\\nspace constraints, only one of the formalisms in this category is\\ndescribed here (and briefly at that): the aforementioned artificial\\nneural\\n networks.[30].\\n Though artificial neural networks, with an appropriate architecture,\\ncould be used for arbitrary computation, they are almost exclusively\\nused for building learning systems. \\n\\nNeural nets are composed of units or nodes designed to\\nrepresent neurons, which are connected by links designed to\\nrepresent dendrites, each of which has a numeric weight.\\n\\n\\n\\nA \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNeuron\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Within an Artificial Neural Network (from\\nAIMA3e)\\n\\n\\nIt is usually assumed that some of the units work in symbiosis with\\nthe external environment; these units form the sets of input\\nand output units. Each unit has a current activation\\nlevel, which is its output, and can compute, based on its inputs\\nand weights on those inputs, its activation level at the next moment\\nin time. This computation is entirely local: a unit takes account of\\nbut its neighbors in the net. This local computation is calculated in\\ntwo stages. First, the input function, \\\\(in_i\\\\), gives the\\nweighted sum of the unit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s input values, that is, the sum of the\\ninput activations multiplied by their weights:  \\n\\n\\\\[\\nin_i = \\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_j W_{ji} a_j\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\nIn the second stage, the activation function, \\\\(g\\\\), takes the\\ninput from the first stage as argument and generates the output, or\\nactivation level, \\\\(a_i\\\\):  \\n\\n\\\\[\\na_i = g(in_i) = g \\\\left(\\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_j W_{ji}a_j\\\\right)\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\nOne common (and confessedly elementary) choice for the activation\\nfunction (which usually governs all units in a given net) is the step\\nfunction, which usually has a threshold \\\\(t\\\\) that sees to it that a 1\\nis output when the input is greater than \\\\(t\\\\), and that 0 is output\\notherwise. This is supposed to be \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbrain-like\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to some\\ndegree, given that 1 represents the firing of a pulse from a neuron\\nthrough an axon, and 0 represents no firing. A simple three-layer\\nneural net is shown in the following picture.\\n\\n\\n\\nA Simple Three-Layer Artificial Neural Network (from\\nAIMA3e)\\n\\n\\nAs you might imagine, there are many different kinds of neural\\nnetworks. The main distinction is between feed-forward and\\nrecurrent networks. In feed-forward networks like the one\\npictured immediately above, as their name suggests, links move\\ninformation in one direction, and there are no cycles; recurrent\\nnetworks allow for cycling back, and can become rather complicated.\\nFor a more detailed presentation, see the\\n\\nSupplement on Neural Nets.\\n \\n\\nNeural networks were fundamentally plagued by the fact that while they\\nare simple and have theoretically efficient learning algorithms, when\\nthey are multi-layered and thus sufficiently expressive to represent\\nnon-linear functions, they were very hard to train in practice. This\\nchanged in the mid 2000s with the advent of methods that exploit\\nstate-of-the-art hardware better (Rajat et al. 2009). The\\nbackpropagation method for training multi-layered neural networks can\\nbe translated into a sequence of repeated simple arithmetic operations\\non a large set of numbers. The general trend in computing hardware has\\nfavored algorithms that are able to do a large of number of simple\\noperations that are not that dependent on each other, versus a small\\nof number of complex and intricate operations.\\n\\nAnother key recent observation is that deep neural networks can be\\npre-trained first in an unsupervised phase where they are just fed\\ndata without any labels for the data. Each hidden layer is forced to\\nrepresent the outputs of the layer below. The outcome of this training\\nis a series of layers which represent the input domain with increasing\\nlevels of abstraction. For example, if we pre-train the network with\\nimages of faces, we would get a first layer which is good at detecting\\nedges in images, a second layer which can combine edges to form facial\\nfeatures such as eyes, noses etc., a third layer which responds to\\ngroups of features, and so on (LeCun et al. 2015).\\n\\nPerhaps the best technique for teaching students about neural networks\\nin the context of other statistical learning formalisms and methods is\\nto focus on a specific problem, preferably one that seems unnatural to\\ntackle using logicist techniques. The task is then to seek to engineer\\na solution to the problem, using any and all techniques\\navailable. One nice problem is handwriting recognition (which\\nalso happens to have a rich philosophical dimension; see e.g.\\nHofstadter & McGraw 1995). For example, consider the problem of\\nassigning, given as input a handwritten digit \\\\(d\\\\), the correct\\ndigit, 0 through 9. Because there is a database of 60,000 labeled\\ndigits available to researchers (from the National Institute of\\nScience and Technology), this problem has evolved into a benchmark\\nproblem for comparing learning algorithms. It turns out that neural\\nnetworks currently reign as the best approach to the problem according\\nto a recent ranking by Benenson (2016).\\n\\nReaders interested in AI (and computational cognitive science) pursued\\nfrom an overtly brain-based orientation are encouraged to explore the\\nwork of Rick Granger (2004a, 2004b) and researchers in his\\n Brain Engineering Laboratory\\n and\\n W. H. Neukom Institute for Computational Sciences.\\n The contrast between the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdry\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, logicist AI started at\\nthe original 1956 conference, and the approach taken here by Granger\\nand associates (in which brain circuitry is directly modeled) is\\nremarkable. For those interested in computational properties of neural\\nnetworks, Hornik et al. (1989) address the general representation\\ncapability of neural networks independent of learning. \\n3.4 AI Beyond the Clash of Paradigms\\n\\nAt this point the reader has been exposed to the chief formalisms in\\nAI, and may wonder about heterogeneous approaches that bridge them. Is\\nthere such research and development in AI? Yes. From an\\nengineering standpoint, such work makes irresistibly good\\nsense. There is now an understanding that, in order to build\\napplications that get the job done, one should choose from a toolbox\\nthat includes logicist, probabilistic/Bayesian, and neurocomputational\\ntechniques. Given that the original top-down logicist paradigm is\\nalive and thriving (e.g., see Brachman & Levesque 2004, Mueller\\n2006), and that, as noted, a resurgence of Bayesian and\\nneurocomputational approaches has placed these two paradigms on solid,\\nfertile footing as well, AI now moves forward, armed with this\\nfundamental triad, and it is a virtual certainty that applications\\n(e.g., robots) will be engineered by drawing from elements of all\\nthree. Watson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s DeepQA architecture is one recent example of an\\nengineering system that leverages multiple paradigms. For a detailed\\ndiscussion, see the\\n\\nSupplement on Watson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s DeepQA Architecture.\\n \\n\\nGoogle DeepMind\\xe2\\x80\\x99s AlphaGo is another example of a multi-paradigm\\nsystem, although in a much narrower form than Watson. The central\\nalgorithmic problem in games such as Go or Chess is to search through\\na vast sequence of valid moves. For most non-trivial games, this is\\nnot feasible to do so exhaustively. The Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS)\\nalgorithm gets around this obstacle by searching through an enormous\\nspace of valid moves in a statistical fashion (Browne et al. 2012).\\nWhile MCTS is the central algorithm in AlpaGo, there are two neural\\nnetworks which help evaluate states in the game and help model how\\nexpert opponents play (Silver et al. 2016). It should be noted that\\nMCTS is behind almost all the winning submissions in general game\\nplaying (Finnsson 2012).\\n\\nWhat, though, about deep, theoretical integration of the main\\nparadigms in AI? Such integration is at present only a possibility for\\nthe future, but readers are directed to the research of some striving\\nfor such integration. For example: Sun (1994, 2002) has been working\\nto demonstrate that human cognition that is on its face symbolic in\\nnature (e.g., professional philosophizing in the analytic tradition,\\nwhich deals explicitly with arguments and definitions carefully\\nsymbolized) can arise from cognition that is neurocomputational in\\nnature. Koller (1997) has investigated the marriage between\\nprobability theory and logic. And, in general, the very recent arrival\\nof so-called human-level AI is being led by theorists seeking\\nto genuinely integrate the three paradigms set out above (e.g.,\\nCassimatis 2006).\\n\\nFinally, we note that cognitive architectures such as Soar\\n(Laird 2012) and PolyScheme (Cassimatis 2006) are another area where\\nintegration of different fields of AI can be found. For example, one\\nsuch endeavor striving to build human-level AI is the Companions\\nproject (Forbus and Hinrichs 2006). Companions are long-lived systems\\nthat strive to be human-level AI systems that function as\\ncollaborators with humans. The Companions architecture tries to solve\\nmultiple AI problems such as reasoning and learning, interactivity,\\nand longevity in one unifying system.\\n4. The Explosive Growth of AI\\n\\nAs we noted above, work on AI has mushroomed over the past couple of\\ndecades. Now that we have looked a bit at the content that composes\\nAI, we take a quick look at the explosive growth of AI.\\n\\nFirst, a point of clarification. The growth of which we speak is not a\\nshallow sort correlated with amount of funding provided for a given\\nsub-field of AI. That kind of thing happens all the time in all\\nfields, and can be triggered by entirely political and financial\\nchanges designed to grow certain areas, and diminish others. Along the\\nsame line, the growth of which we speak is not correlated with the\\namount of industrial activity revolving around AI (or a sub-field\\nthereof); for this sort of growth too can be driven by forces quite\\noutside an expansion in the scientific breadth of\\n AI.[31]\\n Rather, we are speaking of an explosion of deep content: new\\nmaterial which someone intending to be conversant with the field needs\\nto know. Relative to other fields, the size of the explosion may or\\nmay not be unprecedented. (Though it should perhaps be noted that an\\nanalogous increase in philosophy would be marked by the development of\\nentirely new formalisms for reasoning, reflected in the fact that,\\nsay, longstanding philosophy textbooks like Copi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s (2004)\\nIntroduction to Logic are dramatically rewritten and enlarged\\nto include these formalisms, rather than remaining anchored to\\nessentially immutable core formalisms, with incremental refinement\\naround the edges through the years.) But it certainly appears to be\\nquite remarkable, and is worth taking note of here, if for no other\\nreason than that AI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s near-future will revolve in significant\\npart around whether or not the new content in question forms a\\nfoundation for new long-lived research and development that would not\\notherwise\\n obtain.[32]\\n\\nAI has also witnessed an explosion in its usage in various artifacts\\nand applications. While we are nowhere near building a machine with\\ncapabilities of a human or one that acts rationally in all scenarios\\naccording to the Russell/Hutter definition above, algorithms that have\\ntheir origins in AI research are now widely deployed for many tasks in\\na variety of domains. \\n4.1 Bloom in Machine Learning\\n\\nA huge part of AI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s growth in applications has been made\\npossible through invention of new algorithms in the subfield of\\nmachine learning. Machine learning is concerned with building\\nsystems that improve their performance on a task when given examples\\nof ideal performance on the task, or improve their performance with\\nrepeated experience on the task. Algorithms from machine learning have\\nbeen used in speech recognition systems, spam filters, online\\nfraud-detection systems, product-recommendation systems, etc. The\\ncurrent state-of-the-art in machine learning can be divided into three\\nareas (Murphy 2013, Alpaydin 2014):\\n\\nSupervised Learning: A form of learning in which a computer\\ntries to learn a function \\\\(\\\\ff\\\\) given examples, the training data\\n\\\\(T\\\\), of its values at various points in its domain \\n\\n\\\\[\\nT=\\\\left\\\\{\\\\left\\\\langle x_1, \\\\ff(x_1)\\\\right\\\\rangle,\\\\left\\\\langle x_2, \\\\ff(x_2)\\\\right\\\\rangle, \\\\ldots, \\\\left\\\\langle x_n, \\\\ff(x_n)\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\right\\\\}.\\n\\\\] \\n\\n A\\nsample task would be trying to label images of faces with a\\nperson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name. The supervision in supervised learning comes in\\nthe form of the value of the function \\\\(\\\\ff(x)\\\\) at various points\\n\\\\(x\\\\) in some part of the domain of the function. This is usually\\ngiven in the form of a fixed set of input and output pairs for the\\nfunction. Let \\\\(\\\\hh\\\\) be the \\xe2\\x80\\x9clearned function.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The goal\\nof supervised learning is have \\\\({\\\\hh}\\\\) match as closely as possible\\nthe true function \\\\({\\\\ff}\\\\) over the same domain. The error is\\nusually defined in terms of an error function, for instance, \\\\(error =\\n\\\\sum_{x\\\\in T} \\\\delta(\\\\ff(x) - \\\\hh(x))\\\\), over the training data \\\\(T\\\\).\\nOther forms of supervision and goals for learning are possible. For\\nexample, in active learning the learning algorithm can request\\nthe value of the function for arbitrary inputs. Supervised learning\\ndominates the field of machine learning and has been used in almost\\nall practical applications mentioned just above. \\nUnsupervised Learning: Here the machine tries to find\\nuseful knowledge or information when given some raw data \\\\(\\\\left\\\\{\\nx_1,x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n \\\\right\\\\}\\\\). There is no function associated with\\nthe input that has to be learned. The idea is that the machine helps\\nuncover interesting patterns or information that could be hidden in\\nthe data. One use of unsupervised learning is data mining,\\nwhere large volumes of data are searched for interesting information.\\nPageRank, one of the earliest algorithms used by the Google\\nsearch engine, can be considered to be an unsupervised learning system\\nthat ranks pages without any human supervision (Chapter 14.10, Hastie\\net al. 2009). \\nReinforcement Learning: Here a machine is set loose in an\\nenvironment where it constantly acts and perceives (similar to the\\nRussell/Hutter view above) and only occasionally receives\\nfeedback on its behavior in the form of rewards or punishments. The\\nmachine has to learn to behave rationally from this feedback. One use\\nof reinforcement learning has been in building agents to play computer\\ngames. The objective here is to build agents that map sensory data\\nfrom the game at every time instant to an action that would help win\\nin the game or maximize a human player\\xe2\\x80\\x99s enjoyment of the game.\\nIn most games, we know how well we are playing only at the end of the\\ngame or only at infrequent intervals throughout the game (e.g., a\\nchess game that we feel we are winning could quickly turn against us\\nat the end). In supervised learning, the training data has ideal\\ninput-output pairs. This form of learning is not suitable for building\\nagents that have to operate across a length of time and are judged not\\non one action but a series of actions and their effects on the\\nenvironment. The field of Reinforcement Learning tries to tackle this\\nproblem through a variety of methods. Though a bit dated, Sutton and\\nBarto (1998) provide a comprehensive introduction to the field. \\n\\n\\nIn addition to being used in domains that are traditionally the ken of\\nAI, machine-learning algorithms have also been used in all stages of\\nthe scientific process. For example, machine-learning techniques are\\nnow routinely applied to analyze large volumes of data generated from\\nparticle accelerators. CERN, for instance, generates a petabyte\\n(\\\\(10^{15}\\\\) bytes) per second, and statistical algorithms that have\\ntheir origins in AI are used to filter and analyze this data. Particle\\naccelerators are used in fundamental experimental research in physics\\nto probe the structure of our physical universe. They work by\\ncolliding larger particles together to create much finer particles.\\nNot all such events are fruitful. Machine-learning methods have been\\nused to select events which are then analyzed further (Whiteson &\\nWhiteson 2009 and Baldi et al. 2014). More recently, researchers at\\nCERN launched a machine learning\\n  competition\\n to aid in the analysis of the Higgs Boson. The goal of this challenge\\nwas to develop algorithms that separate meaningful events from\\nbackground noise given data from the Large Hadron Collider, a particle\\naccelerator at CERN.\\n\\nIn the past few decades, there has been an explosion in data that does\\nnot have any explicit semantics attached to it. This data is generated\\nby both humans and machines. Most of this data is not easily\\nmachine-processable; for example, images, text, video (as opposed to\\ncarefully curated data in a knowledge- or data-base). This has given\\nrise to a huge industry that applies AI techniques to get usable\\ninformation from such enormous data. This field of applying techniques\\nderived from AI to large volumes of data goes by names such as\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cdata mining,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbig data,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9canalytics,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d etc. This field is too vast to even\\nmoderately cover in the present article, but we note that there is no\\nfull agreement on what constitutes such a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbig-data\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nproblem. One definition, from Madden (2012), is that big data differs\\nfrom traditional machine-processable data in that it is too big (for\\nmost of the existing state-of-the-art hardware), too quick (generated\\nat a fast rate, e.g. online email transactions), or too hard. It is in\\nthe too-hard part that AI techniques work quite well. While this\\nuniverse is quite varied, we use the Watson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s system later in\\nthis article as an AI-relevant exemplar. As we will see later, while\\nmost of this new explosion is powered by learning, it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nentirely limited to just learning. This bloom in learning algorithms\\nhas been supported by both a resurgence in neurocomputational\\ntechniques and probabilistic techniques.\\n4.2 The Resurgence of Neurocomputational Techniques\\n\\nOne of the remarkable aspects of (Charniak & McDermott 1985) is\\nthis: The authors say the central dogma of AI is that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat the\\nbrain does may be thought of at some level as a kind of\\ncomputation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (p. 6). And yet nowhere in the book is brain-like\\ncomputation discussed. In fact, you will search the index in vain for\\nthe term \\xe2\\x80\\x98neural\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and its variants. Please note that the\\nauthors are not to blame for this. A large part of AI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s growth\\nhas come from formalisms, tools, and techniques that are, in some\\nsense, brain-based, not logic-based. A paper that conveys the\\nimportance and maturity of neurocomputation is (Litt et al. 2006).\\n(Growth has also come from a return of probabilistic techniques that\\nhad withered by the mid-70s and 80s. More about that momentarily, in\\nthe next \\xe2\\x80\\x9cresurgence\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n section.)\\n \\n\\nOne very prominent class of non-logicist formalism does make an\\nexplicit nod in the direction of the brain: viz., artificial neural\\nnetworks (or as they are often simply called, neural\\nnetworks, or even just neural nets). (The structure of\\nneural networks and more recent developments are discussed\\n above).\\n Because Minsky and Pappert\\xe2\\x80\\x99s (1969) Perceptrons led many\\n(including, specifically, many sponsors of AI research and\\ndevelopment) to conclude that neural networks didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have\\nsufficient information-processing power to model human cognition, the\\nformalism was pretty much universally dropped from AI. However, Minsky\\nand Pappert had only considered very limited neural networks.\\nConnectionism, the view that intelligence consists not in\\nsymbolic processing, but rather non-symbolic processing at\\nleast somewhat like what we find in the brain (at least at the\\ncellular level), approximated specifically by artificial neural\\nnetworks, came roaring back in the early 1980s on the strength of more\\nsophisticated forms of such networks, and soon the situation was (to\\nuse a metaphor introduced by John McCarthy) that of two horses in a\\nrace toward building truly intelligent agents.\\n\\nIf one had to pick a year at which connectionism was resurrected, it\\nwould certainly be 1986, the year Parallel Distributed\\nProcessing (Rumelhart & McClelland 1986) appeared in print.\\nThe rebirth of connectionism was specifically fueled by the\\nback-propagation (backpropagation) algorithm over neural networks,\\nnicely covered in Chapter 20 of AIMA. The\\nsymbolicist/connectionist race led to a spate of lively debate in the\\nliterature (e.g., Smolensky 1988, Bringsjord 1991), and some AI\\nengineers have explicitly championed a methodology marked by a\\nrejection of knowledge representation and reasoning. For example,\\nRodney Brooks was such an engineer; he wrote the well-known\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIntelligence Without Representation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (1991), and his Cog\\nProject, to which we referred above, is arguably an incarnation of the\\npremeditatedly non-logicist approach. Increasingly, however, those in\\nthe business of building sophisticated systems find that both\\nlogicist and more neurocomputational techniques are required (Wermter\\n& Sun\\n 2001).[33]\\n In addition, the neurocomputational paradigm today includes\\nconnectionism only as a proper part, in light of the fact that some of\\nthose working on building intelligent systems strive to do so by\\nengineering brain-based computation outside the neural network-based\\napproach (e.g., Granger 2004a, 2004b). \\n\\nAnother recent resurgence in neurocomputational techniques has\\noccurred in machine learning. The modus operandi in machine learning\\nis that given a problem, say recognizing handwritten digits\\n\\\\(\\\\{0,1,\\\\ldots,9\\\\}\\\\) or faces, from a 2D matrix representing an image\\nof the digits or faces, a machine learning or a domain expert would\\nconstruct a feature vector representation function for the\\ntask. This function is a transformation of the input into a format\\nthat tries to throw away irrelevant information in the input and keep\\nonly information useful for the task. Inputs transformed by \\\\(\\\\rr\\\\)\\nare termed features. For recognizing faces, irrelevant\\ninformation could be the amount of lighting in the scene and relevant\\ninformation could be information about facial features. The machine is\\nthen fed a sequence of inputs represented by the features and the\\nideal or ground truth output values for those inputs. This converts\\nthe learning challenge from that of having to learn the function\\n\\\\(\\\\ff\\\\) from the examples: \\\\(\\\\left\\\\{\\\\left\\\\langle x_1,\\n\\\\ff(x_1)\\\\right\\\\rangle,\\\\left\\\\langle x_2, \\\\ff(x_2)\\\\right\\\\rangle, \\\\ldots,\\n\\\\left\\\\langle x_n, \\\\ff(x_n)\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\right\\\\}\\\\) to having to learn\\nfrom possibly easier data: \\\\(\\\\left\\\\{\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\rr(x_1),\\n\\\\ff(x_1)\\\\right\\\\rangle,\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\rr(x_2), \\\\ff(x_2)\\\\right\\\\rangle,\\n\\\\ldots, \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\rr(x_n), \\\\ff(x_n)\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\right\\\\}\\\\). Here\\nthe function \\\\(\\\\rr\\\\) is the function that computes the feature vector\\nrepresentation of the input. Formally, \\\\(\\\\ff\\\\) is assumed to be a\\ncomposition of the functions \\\\(\\\\gg\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\rr\\\\). That is, for any\\ninput \\\\(x\\\\), \\\\(f(x) = \\\\gg\\\\left(\\\\rr\\\\left(x\\\\right)\\\\right)\\\\). This is\\ndenoted by \\\\(\\\\ff=\\\\gg\\\\circ \\\\rr\\\\). For any input, the features are first\\ncomputed, and then the function \\\\(\\\\gg\\\\) is applied. If the feature\\nrepresentation \\\\(\\\\rr\\\\) is provided by the domain expert, the learning\\nproblem becomes simpler to the extent the feature representation takes\\non the difficulty of the task. At one extreme, the feature vector\\ncould hide an easily extractable form of the answer in the input and\\nin the other extreme the feature representation could be just the\\nplain input.\\n\\nFor non-trivial problems, choosing the right representation is vital.\\nFor instance, one of the drastic changes in the AI landscape was due\\nto Minsky and Papert\\xe2\\x80\\x99s (1969) demonstration that the perceptron\\ncannot learn even the binary XOR function, but this function\\ncan be learnt by the perceptron if we have the right representation.\\nFeature engineering has grown to be one of the most labor intensive\\ntasks of machine learning, so much so that it is considered to be one\\nof the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cblack arts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of machine learning. The other\\nsignificant black art of learning methods is choosing the right\\nparameters. These black arts require significant human expertise and\\nexperience, which can be quite difficult to obtain without significant\\napprenticeship (Domingos 2012). Another bigger issue is that the task\\nof feature engineering is just knowledge representation in a new skin.\\n\\n\\nGiven this state of affairs, there has been a recent resurgence in\\nmethods for automatically learning a feature representation function\\n\\\\(\\\\rr\\\\); such methods potentially bypass a large part of human labor\\nthat is traditionally required. Such methods are based mostly on what\\nare now termed deep neural networks. Such networks are simply\\nneural networks with two or more hidden layers. These networks allow\\nus to learn a feature function \\\\(\\\\rr\\\\) by using one or more of the\\nhidden layers to learn \\\\(\\\\rr\\\\). The general form of learning in which\\none learns from the raw sensory data without much hand-based feature\\nengineering has now its own term: deep learning. A general and\\nyet concise definition (Bengio et al. 2015) is: \\n\\nDeep learning can safely be regarded as the study of models that\\neither involve a greater amount of composition of learned functions or\\nlearned concepts than traditional machine learning does. (Bengio et\\nal. 2015, Chapter 1)\\n\\n\\nThough the idea has been around for decades, recent innovations\\nleading to more efficient learning techniques have made the approach\\nmore feasible (Bengio et al. 2013). Deep-learning methods have\\nrecently produced state-of-the-art results in image recognition (given\\nan image containing various objects, label the objects from a given\\nset of labels), speech recognition (from audio input, generate a\\ntextual representation), and the analysis of data from particle\\naccelerators (LeCun et al. 2015). Despite impressive results in tasks\\nsuch as these, minor and major issues remain unresolved. A minor issue\\nis that significant human expertise is still needed to choose an\\narchitecture and set up the right parameters for the architecture; a\\nmajor issue is the existence of so-called adversarial inputs,\\nwhich are indistinguishable from normal inputs to humans but are\\ncomputed in a special manner that makes a neural network regard them\\nas different than similar inputs in the training data. The existence\\nof such adversarial inputs, which remain stable across training data,\\nhas raised doubts about how well performance on benchmarks can\\ntranslate into performance in real-world systems with sensory noise\\n(Szegedy et al. 2014).\\n4.3 The Resurgence of Probabilistic Techniques\\n\\nThere is a second dimension to the explosive growth of AI: the\\nexplosion in popularity of probabilistic methods that aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nneurocomputational in nature, in order to formalize and mechanize a\\nform of non-logicist reasoning in the face of uncertainty.\\nInterestingly enough, it is Eugene Charniak himself who can be safely\\nconsidered one of the leading proponents of an explicit, premeditated\\nturn away from logic to statistical techniques. His area of\\nspecialization is natural language processing, and whereas his\\nintroductory textbook of 1985 gave an accurate sense of his approach\\nto parsing at the time (as we have seen, write computer programs that,\\ngiven English text as input, ultimately infer meaning expressed in\\nFOL), this approach was abandoned in favor of purely statistical\\napproaches (Charniak 1993). At the\\n AI@50\\n conference, Charniak boldly proclaimed, in a talk tellingly entitled\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy Natural Language Processing is Now Statistical Natural\\nLanguage Processing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that logicist AI is moribund, and that the\\nstatistical approach is the only promising game in town \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for\\nthe next 50\\n years.[34]\\n\\nThe chief source of energy and debate at the conference flowed from\\nthe clash between Charniak\\xe2\\x80\\x99s probabilistic orientation, and the\\noriginal logicist orientation, upheld at the conference in question by\\nJohn McCarthy and others.\\n\\nAI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s use of probability theory grows out of the standard form of\\nthis theory, which grew directly out of technical philosophy and\\nlogic. This form will be familiar to many philosophers, but\\nlet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s review it quickly now, in order to set a firm stage for\\nmaking points about the new probabilistic techniques that have\\nenergized AI. \\n\\nJust as in the case of FOL, in probability theory we are concerned\\nwith declarative statements, or propositions, to which degrees\\nof belief are applied; we can thus say that both logicist and\\nprobabilistic approaches are symbolic in nature. Both approaches also\\nagree that statements can either be true or false in the world. In\\nbuilding agents, a simplistic logic-based approach requires agents to\\nknow the truth-value of all possible statements. This is not\\nrealistic, as an agent may not know the truth-value of some\\nproposition \\\\(p\\\\) due to either ignorance, non-determinism in the\\nphysical world, or just plain vagueness in the meaning of the\\nstatement. More specifically, the fundamental proposition in\\nprobability theory is a random variable, which can be conceived\\nof as an aspect of the world whose status is initially unknown to the\\nagent. We usually capitalize the names of random variables, though we\\nreserve \\\\(p,q,r, \\\\ldots\\\\) as such names as well. For example, in a\\nparticular murder investigation centered on whether or not Mr. Barolo\\ncommitted the crime, the random variable \\\\(Guilty\\\\) might be of\\nconcern. The detective may be interested as well in whether or not the\\nmurder weapon \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a particular knife, let us assume \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nbelongs to Barolo. In light of this, we might say that \\\\(\\\\Weapon =\\n\\\\true\\\\) if it does, and \\\\(\\\\Weapon = \\\\false\\\\) if it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. As a\\nnotational convenience, we can write \\\\(weapon\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\lnot weapon\\\\)\\nand for these two cases, respectively; and we can use this convention\\nfor other variables of this type. \\n\\nThe kind of variables we have described so far are\\n\\\\(\\\\mathbf{Boolean}\\\\), because their \\\\(\\\\mathbf{domain}\\\\) is simply\\n\\\\(\\\\{true,false\\\\}.\\\\) But we can generalize and allow\\n\\\\(\\\\mathbf{discrete}\\\\) random variables, whose values are from any\\ncountable domain. For example, \\\\(\\\\PriceTChina\\\\) might be a variable\\nfor the price of (a particular, presumably) tea in China, and its\\ndomain might be \\\\(\\\\{1,2,3,4,5\\\\}\\\\), where each number here is in US\\ndollars. A third type of variable is \\\\(\\\\mathbf{continous}\\\\); its\\ndomain is either the reals, or some subset thereof. \\n\\nWe say that an atomic event is an assignment of particular\\nvalues from the appropriate domains to all the variables composing the\\n(idealized) world. For example, in the simple murder investigation\\nworld introduced just above, we have two Boolean variables,\\n\\\\(\\\\Guilty\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\Weapon\\\\), and there are just four atomic events.\\nNote that atomic events have some obvious properties. For example,\\nthey are mutually exclusive, exhaustive, and logically entail the\\ntruth or falsity of every proposition. Usually not obvious to\\nbeginning students is a fourth property, namely, any proposition is\\nlogically equivalent to the disjunction of all atomic events that\\nentail that proposition. \\n\\nPrior probabilities correspond to a degree of belief accorded to a\\nproposition in the complete absence of any other information. For\\nexample, if the prior probability of Barolo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s guilt is \\\\(0.2\\\\),\\nwe write \\n\\n    \\\\[\\n    P\\\\left(\\\\Guilty=true\\\\right)=0.2\\n    \\\\]\\n\\n \\n\\nor simply \\\\(\\\\P(guilty)=0.2\\\\). It is often convenient to have a\\nnotation allowing one to refer economically to the probabilities of\\nall the possible values for a random variable. For example,\\nwe can write \\n\\n    \\\\[\\n    \\\\P\\\\left(\\\\PriceTChina\\\\right)\\n    \\\\]\\n\\n \\n\\nas an abbreviation for the five equations listing all the possible\\nprices for tea in China. We can also write \\n\\n    \\\\[\\n    \\\\P\\\\left(\\\\PriceTChina\\\\right)=\\\\langle 1,2,3,4,5\\\\rangle\\n    \\\\]\\n\\n \\n\\nIn addition, as further convenient notation, we can write \\\\(\\n\\\\mathbf{P}\\\\left(\\\\Guilty, \\\\Weapon\\\\right)\\\\) to denote the probabilities\\nof all combinations of values of the relevant set of random variables.\\nThis is referred to as the joint probability distribution of\\n\\\\(\\\\Guilty\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\Weapon\\\\). The full joint probability\\ndistribution covers the distribution for all the random variables used\\nto describe a world. Given our simple murder world, we have 20 atomic\\nevents summed up in the equation \\n\\n    \\\\[\\n    \\\\mathbf{P}\\\\left(\\\\Guilty, \\\\Weapon, \\\\PriceTChina\\\\right)\\n    \\\\]\\n\\n \\n\\nThe final piece of the basic language of probability theory\\ncorresponds to conditional probabilities. Where \\\\(p\\\\) and \\\\(q\\\\)\\nare any propositions, the relevant expression is \\\\(P\\\\!\\\\left(p\\\\given\\nq\\\\right)\\\\), which can be interpreted as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe probability of\\n\\\\(p\\\\), given that all we know is \\\\(q\\\\).\\xe2\\x80\\x9d For example,\\n\\n    \\\\[\\n    P\\\\left(guilty\\\\ggiven weapon\\\\right)=0.7\\n    \\\\]\\n\\n \\n\\nsays that if the murder weapon belongs to Barolo, and no other\\ninformation is available, the probability that Barolo is guilty is\\n\\\\(0.7.\\\\) \\n\\nAndrei Kolmogorov showed how to construct probability theory from\\nthree axioms that make use of the machinery now introduced, viz., \\n\\n All probabilities fall between \\\\(0\\\\) and \\\\(1.\\\\) I.e., \\\\(\\\\forall\\np. 0 \\\\leq P(p) \\\\leq 1\\\\). \\n Valid (in the traditional logicist sense) propositions have a\\nprobability of \\\\(1\\\\); unsatisfiable (in the traditional logicist\\nsense) propositions have a probability of \\\\(0\\\\). \\n \\\\(P(p\\\\lor q) = P(p) +P(q) - P(p\\\\land q)\\\\) \\n\\n\\nThese axioms are clearly at bottom logicist. The remainder of\\nprobability theory can be erected from this foundation (conditional\\nprobabilities are easily defined in terms of prior probabilities). We\\ncan thus say that logic is in some fundamental sense still being used\\nto characterize the set of beliefs that a rational agent can have. But\\nwhere does probabilistic inference enter the picture on this\\naccount, since traditional deduction is not used for inference in\\nprobability theory?\\n\\nProbabilistic inference consists in computing, from observed evidence\\nexpressed in terms of probability theory, posterior probabilities of\\npropositions of interest. For a good long while, there have been\\nalgorithms for carrying out such computation. These algorithms precede\\nthe resurgence of probabilistic techniques in the 1990s. (Chapter 13\\nof AIMA presents a number of them.) For example, given the\\nKolmogorov axioms, here is a straightforward way of computing the\\nprobability of any proposition, using the full joint distribution\\ngiving the probabilities of all atomic events: Where \\\\(p\\\\) is some\\nproposition, let \\\\(\\\\alpha(p)\\\\) be the disjunction of all atomic events\\nin which \\\\(p\\\\) holds. Since the probability of a proposition (i.e.,\\n\\\\(P(p)\\\\)) is equal to the sum of the probabilities of the atomic\\nevents in which it holds, we have an equation that provides a method\\nfor computing the probability of any proposition \\\\(p\\\\), viz., \\n\\n\\\\[\\n P(p) = \\\\sum_{e_i\\\\in\\\\alpha(p)} P(e_i)\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, there were two serious problems infecting this original\\nprobabilistic approach: One, the processing in question needed to take\\nplace over paralyzingly large amounts of information (enumeration over\\nthe entire distribution is required). And two, the expressivity of the\\napproach was merely propositional. (It was by the way the philosopher\\nHilary Putnam (1963) who pointed out that there was a price to pay in\\nmoving to the first-order level. The issue is not discussed herein.)\\nEverything changed with the advent of a new formalism that marks the\\nmarriage of probabilism and graph theory: Bayesian networks\\n(also called belief nets). The pivotal text was (Pearl 1988).\\nFor a more detailed discussion, see the\\n\\nSupplement on Bayesian Networks.\\n \\n\\nBefore concluding this section, it is probably worth noting that, from\\nthe standpoint of philosophy, a situation such as the murder\\ninvestigation we have exploited above would often be analyzed into\\narguments, and strength factors, not into numbers to be\\ncrunched by purely arithmetical procedures. For example, in the\\nepistemology of Roderick Chisholm, as presented his Theory of\\nKnowledge (1966, 1977), Detective Holmes might classify a\\nproposition like  Barolo committed the murder. as\\ncounterbalanced if he was unable to find a compelling argument\\neither way, or perhaps probable if the murder weapon turned out\\nto belong to Barolo. Such categories cannot be found on a continuum\\nfrom 0 to 1, and they are used in articulating arguments for or\\nagainst Barolo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s guilt. Argument-based approaches to uncertain\\nand defeasible reasoning are virtually non-existent in AI. One\\nexception is Pollock\\xe2\\x80\\x99s approach, covered below. This approach is\\nChisholmian in nature. \\n\\nIt should also be noted that there have been well-established\\nformalisms for dealing with probabilistic reasoning as an instance of\\nlogic-based reasoning. E.g., the activity a researcher in\\nprobabilistic reasoning undertakes when she proves a theorem \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\)\\nabout their domain (e.g. any theorem in (Pearl 1988)) is purely within\\nthe realm of traditional logic. Readers interested in logic-flavored\\napproaches to probabilistic reasoning can consult (Adams 1996,\\nHailperin 1996 & 2010, Halpern 1998). Formalisms marrying\\nprobability theory, induction and deductive reasoning, placing them on\\nan equal footing, have been on the rise, with Markov logic (Richardson\\nand Domingos 2006) being salient among these approaches. \\n\\nProbabilistic Machine Learning\\n\\nMachine learning, in the sense given\\n above,\\n has been associated with probabilistic techniques. Probabilistic\\ntechniques have been associated with both the learning of functions\\n(e.g. Naive Bayes classification) and the modeling of theoretical\\nproperties of learning algorithms. For example, a standard\\nreformulation of supervised learning casts it as a Bayesian\\nproblem. Assume that we are looking at recognizing digits\\n\\\\([0{-}9]\\\\) from a given image. One way to cast this problem is to ask\\nwhat the probability that the hypothesis \\\\(H_x\\\\): \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe digit\\nis \\\\(x\\\\)\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is true given the image \\\\(d\\\\) from a sensor. Bayes\\ntheorem gives us:  \\n\\n\\\\[\\n P\\\\left(H_x\\\\ggiven  d\\\\right) = \\\\frac{P\\\\left(d\\\\ggiven  H_x\\\\right)*P\\\\left(H_x\\\\right)}{P\\\\left(d\\\\right)}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\n\\\\(P(d\\\\given H_x)\\\\) and \\\\(P(H_x)\\\\) can be estimated from the given\\ntraining dataset. Then the hypothesis with the highest posterior\\nprobability is then given as the answer and is given by:\\n\\\\(\\\\argmax_{x}P\\\\left(d\\\\ggiven H_x\\\\right)*P\\\\left(H_x\\\\right) \\\\) In\\naddition to probabilistic methods being used to build algorithms,\\nprobability theory has also been used to analyze algorithms which\\nmight not have an overt probabilistic or logical formulation. For\\nexample, one of the central classes of meta-theorems in learning,\\nprobably approximately correct (PAC) theorems, are cast in\\nterms of lower bounds of the probability that the mismatch between the\\ninduced/learnt fL function and the true function\\nfT being less than a certain amount, given that the\\nlearnt function fL works well for a certain number\\nof cases (see Chapter 18, AIMA). \\n5. AI in the Wild\\n\\nFrom at least its modern inception, AI has always been connected to\\ngadgets, often ones produced by corporations, and it would be remiss\\nof us not to say a few words about this phenomenon. While there have\\nbeen a large number of commercial in-the-wild success stories for AI\\nand its sister fields, such as optimization and decision-making, some\\napplications are more visible and have been thoroughly battle-tested\\nin the wild. In 2014, one of the most visible such domains (one in\\nwhich AI has been strikingly successful) is information retrieval,\\nincarnated as web search. Another recent success story is pattern\\nrecognition. The state-of-the-art in applied pattern recognition\\n(e.g., fingerprint/face verification, speech recognition, and\\nhandwriting recognition) is robust enough to allow\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9chigh-stakes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d deployment outside the laboratory. As of mid\\n2018, several corporations and research laboratories have begun\\ntesting autonomous vehicles on public roads, with even a handful of\\njurisdictions making self-driving cars legal to operate. For example,\\nGoogle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s autonomous cars have navigated hundreds of thousands of\\nmiles in California with minimal human help under non-trivial\\nconditions (Guizzo 2011). \\n\\nComputer games provide a robust test bed for AI techniques as they can\\ncapture important parts that might be necessary to test an AI\\ntechnique while abstracting or removing details that might beyond the\\nscope of core AI research, for example, designing better hardware or\\ndealing with legal issues (Laird and VanLent 2001). One subclass of\\ngames that has seen quite fruitful for commercial deployment of AI is\\nreal-time strategy games. Real-time strategy games are games in which\\nplayers manage an army given limited resources. One objective is to\\nconstantly battle other players and reduce an opponent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s forces.\\nReal-time strategy games differ from strategy games in that players\\nplan their actions simultaneously in real-time and do not have to take\\nturns playing. Such games have a number of challenges that are\\ntantalizing within the grasp of the state-of-the-art. This makes such\\ngames an attractive venue in which to deploy simple AI agents. An\\noverview of AI used in real-time strategy games can be found in\\n(Robertson and Watson 2015). \\n\\nSome other ventures in AI, despite significant success, have been only\\nchugging slowly and humbly along, quietly. For instance, AI-related\\nmethods have achieved triumphs in solving open problems in mathematics\\nthat have resisted any solution for decades. The most noteworthy\\ninstance of such a problem is perhaps a proof of the statement that\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll Robbins algebras are Boolean algebras.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This\\nwas conjectured in the 1930s, and the proof was finally discovered by\\nthe Otter automatic theorem-prover in 1996 after just a few months of\\neffort (Kolata 1996, Wos 2013). Sister fields like formal verification\\nhave also bloomed to the extent that it is now not too difficult to\\nsemi-automatically verify vital hardware/software components (Kaufmann\\net al. 2000 and Chajed et al. 2017).\\n\\nOther related areas, such as (natural) language translation, still\\nhave a long way to go, but are good enough to let us use them under\\nrestricted conditions. The jury is out on tasks such as machine\\ntranslation, which seems to require both statistical methods (Lopez\\n2008) and symbolic methods (Espa\\xc3\\xb1a-Bonet 2011). Both\\nmethods now have comparable but limited success in the wild. A\\ndeployed translation system at Ford that was initially developed for\\ntranslating manufacturing process instructions from English to other\\nlanguages initially started out as rule-based system with Ford and\\ndomain-specific vocabulary and language. This system then evolved to\\nincorporate statistical techniques along with rule-based techniques as\\nit gained new uses beyond translating manuals, for example, lay users\\nwithin Ford translating their own documents (Rychtyckyj and Plesco\\n2012). \\n\\nAI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great achievements mentioned above so far have all been in\\nlimited, narrow domains. This lack of any success in the unrestricted\\ngeneral case has caused a small set of researchers to break away into\\nwhat is now called\\n  artificial general intelligence\\n (Goertzel and Pennachin 2007). The stated goals of this movement\\ninclude shifting the focus again to building artifacts that are\\ngenerally intelligent and not just capable in one narrow domain. \\n6. Moral AI\\n\\nComputer Ethics has been around for a long time. In this\\nsub-field, typically one would consider how one ought to act in a\\ncertain class of situations involving computer technology, where the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cone\\xe2\\x80\\x9d here refers to a human being (Moor 1985). So-called\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9crobot ethics\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is different. In this sub-field (which goes\\nby names such as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmoral AI,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cethical AI,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cmachine ethics,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmoral robots,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d etc.) one is\\nconfronted with such prospects as robots being able to make autonomous\\nand weighty decisions \\xe2\\x80\\x93 decisions that might or might not be\\nmorally permissible (Wallach & Allen 2010). If one were to attempt\\nto engineer a robot with a capacity for sophisticated ethical\\nreasoning and decision-making, one would also be doing Philosophical\\nAI, as that concept is characterized\\n elsewhere\\n in the present entry. There can be many different flavors of\\napproaches toward Moral AI. Wallach and Allen (2010) provide a\\nhigh-level overview of the different approaches. Moral reasoning is\\nobviously needed in robots that have the capability for lethal action.\\nArkin (2009) provides an introduction to how we can control and\\nregulate machines that have the capacity for lethal behavior. Moral AI\\ngoes beyond obviously lethal situations, and we can have a spectrum of\\nmoral machines. Moor (2006) provides one such spectrum of possible\\nmoral agents. An example of a non-lethal but ethically-charged machine\\nwould be a lying machine. Clark (2010) uses a computational theory\\nof the mind, the ability to represent and reason about other\\nagents, to build a lying machine that successfully persuades people\\ninto believing falsehoods. Bello & Bringsjord (2013) give a\\ngeneral overview of what might be required to build a moral machine,\\none of the ingredients being a theory of mind. \\n\\nThe most general framework for building machines that can reason\\nethically consists in endowing the machines with a moral code.\\nThis requires that the formal framework used for reasoning by the\\nmachine be expressive enough to receive such codes. The field of Moral\\nAI, for now, is not concerned with the source or provenance of such\\ncodes. The source could be humans, and the machine could receive the\\ncode directly (via explicit encoding) or indirectly (reading). Another\\npossibility is that the code is inferred by the machine from a more\\nbasic set of laws. We assume that the robot has access to some such\\ncode, and we then try to engineer the robot to follow that code under\\nall circumstances while making sure that the moral code and its\\nrepresentation do not lead to unintended consequences. Deontic\\nlogics are a class of formal logics that have been studied the\\nmost for this purpose. Abstractly, such logics are concerned mainly\\nwith what follows from a given moral code. Engineering then studies\\nthe match of a given deontic logic to a moral code (i.e., is the logic\\nexpressive enough) which has to be balanced with the ease of\\nautomation. Bringsjord et al. (2006) provide a blueprint for using\\ndeontic logics to build systems that can perform actions in accordance\\nwith a moral code. The role deontic logics play in the framework\\noffered by Bringsjord et al (which can be considered to be\\nrepresentative of the field of deontic logic for moral AI) can be best\\nunderstood as striving towards Leibniz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dream of a universal\\nmoral calculus: \\n\\nWhen controversies arise, there will be no more need for a disputation\\nbetween two philosophers than there would be between two accountants\\n[computistas]. It would be enough for them to pick up their pens and\\nsit at their abacuses, and say to each other (perhaps having summoned\\na mutual friend): \\xe2\\x80\\x98Let us calculate.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\nDeontic logic-based frameworks can also be used in a fashion that is\\nanalogous to moral self-reflection. In this mode, logic-based\\nverification of the robot\\xe2\\x80\\x99s internal modules can done before the\\nrobot ventures out into the real world. Govindarajulu and Bringsjord\\n(2015) present an approach, drawing from formal-program\\nverification, in which a deontic-logic based system could be used\\nto verify that a robot acts in a certain ethically-sanctioned manner\\nunder certain conditions. Since formal-verification approaches can be\\nused to assert statements about an infinite number of situations and\\nconditions, such approaches might be preferred to having the robot\\nroam around in an ethically-charged test environment and make a finite\\nset of decisions that are then judged for their ethical correctness.\\nMore recently, Govindarajulu and Bringsjord (2017) use a deontic logic\\nto present a computational model of the\\n Doctrine of Double Effect,\\n an ethical principle for moral dilemmas that has been studied\\nempirically and analyzed extensively by\\n philosophers.[35]\\n The principle is usually presented and motivated via dilemmas using\\ntrolleys and was first presented in this fashion by Foot (1967). \\n\\nWhile there has been substantial theoretical and philosophical work,\\nthe field of machine ethics is still in its infancy. There has been\\nsome embryonic work in building ethical machines. One recent such\\nexample would be Pereira and Saptawijaya (2016) who use logic\\nprogramming and base their work in machine ethics on the ethical\\ntheory known as contractualism, set out by Scanlon (1982). And\\nwhat about the future? Since artificial agents are bound to get\\nsmarter and smarter, and to have more and more autonomy and\\nresponsibility, robot ethics is almost certainly going to grow in\\nimportance. This endeavor might not be a straightforward application\\nof classical ethics. For example, experimental results suggest that\\nhumans hold robots to different ethical standards than they expect\\nfrom humans under similar conditions (Malle et al.\\n 2015).[36]\\n\\n7. Philosophical AI\\n\\nNotice that the heading for this section isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t Philosophy\\nof AI. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get to that category momentarily. (For now\\nit can be identified with the attempt to answer such questions as\\nwhether artificial agents created in AI can ever reach the full\\nheights of human intelligence.) Philosophical AI is AI, not\\nphilosophy; but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s AI rooted in and flowing from, philosophy.\\nFor example, one could engage, using the tools and techniques of\\nphilosophy, a paradox, work out a proposed solution, and then proceed\\nto a step that is surely optional for philosophers: expressing the\\nsolution in terms that can be translated into a computer program that,\\nwhen executed, allows an artificial agent to surmount concrete\\ninstances of the original\\n paradox.[37]\\n Before we ostensively characterize Philosophical AI of this sort\\ncourtesy of a particular research program, let us consider first the\\nview that AI is in fact simply philosophy, or a part thereof. \\n\\nDaniel Dennett (1979) has famously claimed not just that there are\\nparts of AI intimately bound up with philosophy, but that AI\\nis philosophy (and psychology, at least of the cognitive\\nsort). (He has made a parallel claim about Artificial Life (Dennett\\n1998)). This view will turn out to be incorrect, but the reasons why\\nit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wrong will prove illuminating, and our discussion will pave\\nthe way for a discussion of Philosophical AI. \\n\\nWhat does Dennett say, exactly? This: \\n\\nI want to claim that AI is better viewed as sharing with traditional\\nepistemology the status of being a most general, most abstract asking\\nof the top-down question: how is knowledge possible? (Dennett 1979,\\n60)\\n\\n\\nElsewhere he says his view is that AI should be viewed \\xe2\\x80\\x9cas a\\nmost abstract inquiry into the possibility of intelligence or\\nknowledge\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Dennett 1979, 64). \\n\\nIn short, Dennett holds that AI is the attempt to explain\\nintelligence, not by studying the brain in the hopes of identifying\\ncomponents to which cognition can be reduced, and not by engineering\\nsmall information-processing units from which one can build in\\nbottom-up fashion to high-level cognitive processes, but rather by\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 and this is why he says the approach is top-down\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 designing and implementing abstract algorithms that capture\\ncognition. Leaving aside the fact that, at least starting in the early\\n1980s, AI includes an approach that is in some sense bottom-up (see\\nthe neurocomputational paradigm discussed above, in\\n Non-Logicist AI: A Summary;\\n and see, specifically, Granger\\xe2\\x80\\x99s (2004a, 2004b) work,\\nhyperlinked in text immediately above, a specific counterexample), a\\nfatal flaw infects Dennett\\xe2\\x80\\x99s view. Dennett sees the potential\\nflaw, as reflected in: \\n\\nIt has seemed to some philosophers that AI cannot plausibly be so\\nconstrued because it takes on an additional burden: it restricts\\nitself to mechanistic solutions, and hence its domain is not\\nthe Kantian domain of all possible modes of intelligence, but just all\\npossible mechanistically realizable modes of intelligence. This, it is\\nclaimed, would beg the question against vitalists, dualists, and other\\nanti-mechanists. (Dennett 1979, 61)\\n\\n\\nDennett has a ready answer to this objection. He writes: \\n\\nBut \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 the mechanism requirement of AI is not an additional\\nconstraint of any moment, for if psychology is possible at all, and if\\nChurch\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thesis is true, the constraint of mechanism is no more\\nsevere than the constraint against begging the question in psychology,\\nand who would wish to evade that? (Dennett 1979, 61)\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, this is acutely problematic; and examination of the\\nproblems throws light on the nature of AI. \\n\\nFirst, insofar as philosophy and psychology are concerned with the\\nnature of mind, they aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t in the least trammeled by the\\npresupposition that mentation consists in computation. AI, at least of\\nthe \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrong\\xe2\\x80\\x9d variety (we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll discuss\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrong\\xe2\\x80\\x9d versus \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWeak\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AI\\n below)\\n is indeed an attempt to substantiate, through engineering certain\\nimpressive artifacts, the thesis that intelligence is at bottom\\ncomputational (at the level of Turing machines and their equivalents,\\ne.g., Register machines). So there is a philosophical claim, for sure.\\nBut this doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make AI philosophy, any more than some of the\\ndeeper, more aggressive claims of some physicists (e.g., that the\\n universe is ultimately digital in nature)\\n make their field philosophy. Philosophy of physics certainly\\nentertains the proposition that the physical universe can be\\nperfectly modeled in digital terms (in a series of cellular automata,\\ne.g.), but of course philosophy of physics can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be\\nidentified with this doctrine. \\n\\nSecond, we now know well (and those familiar with the relevant formal\\nterrain knew at the time of Dennett\\xe2\\x80\\x99s writing) that information\\nprocessing can exceed standard computation, that is, can exceed\\ncomputation at and below the level of what a Turing machine can muster\\n(Turing-computation, we shall say). (Such information\\nprocessing is known as hypercomputation, a term coined by\\nphilosopher Jack Copeland, who has himself defined such machines\\n(e.g., Copeland 1998). The first machines capable of hypercomputation\\nwere trial-and-error machines, introduced in the same famous\\nissue of the Journal of Symbolic Logic (Gold 1965; Putnam\\n1965). A new hypercomputer is the infinite time Turing machine\\n(Hamkins & Lewis 2000).) Dennett\\xe2\\x80\\x99s appeal to Church\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nthesis thus flies in the face of the mathematical facts: some\\nvarieties of information processing exceed standard computation (or\\nTuring-computation). Church\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thesis, or more precisely, the\\nChurch-Turing thesis, is the view that a function \\\\(f\\\\) is effectively\\ncomputable if and only if \\\\(f\\\\) is Turing-computable (i.e., some\\nTuring machine can compute \\\\(f\\\\)). Thus, this thesis has nothing to\\nsay about information processing that is more demanding than what a\\nTuring machine can achieve. (Put another way, there is no\\ncounter-example to CTT to be automatically found in an\\ninformation-processing device capable of feats beyond the reach of\\nTMs.) For all philosophy and psychology know, intelligence, even if\\ntied to information processing, exceeds what is Turing-computational\\nor\\n Turing-mechanical.[38]\\n This is especially true because philosophy and psychology, unlike AI,\\nare in no way fundamentally charged with engineering artifacts, which\\nmakes the physical realizability of hypercomputation irrelevant from\\ntheir perspectives. Therefore, contra Dennett, to consider AI\\nas psychology or philosophy is to commit a serious error, precisely\\nbecause so doing would box these fields into only a speck of the\\nentire space of functions from the natural numbers (including tuples\\ntherefrom) to the natural numbers. (Only a tiny portion of the\\nfunctions in this space are Turing-computable.) AI is without question\\nmuch, much narrower than this pair of fields. Of course, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\npossible that AI could be replaced by a field devoted not to building\\ncomputational artifacts by writing computer programs and running them\\non embodied Turing machines. But this new field, by definition, would\\nnot be AI. Our exploration of AIMA and other textbooks provide\\ndirect empirical confirmation of this. \\n\\nThird, most AI researchers and developers, in point of fact, are\\nsimply concerned with building useful, profitable artifacts, and\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t spend much time reflecting upon the kinds of abstract\\ndefinitions of intelligence explored in this entry (e.g.,\\n What Exactly is AI?).\\n \\n\\nThough AI isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t philosophy, there are certainly ways of doing\\nreal implementation-focussed AI of the highest caliber that are\\nintimately bound up with philosophy. The best way to demonstrate this\\nis to simply present such research and development, or at least a\\nrepresentative example thereof. While there have been many examples of\\nsuch work, the most prominent example in AI is John Pollock\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nOSCAR project, which stretched over a considerable portion of his\\nlifetime. For a detailed presentation and further discussion, see\\nthe\\n\\nSupplement on the OSCAR Project.\\n\\n\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important to note at this juncture that the OSCAR project,\\nand the information processing that underlies it, are without question\\nat once philosophy and technical AI. Given that the work in\\nquestion has appeared in the pages of Artificial Intelligence,\\na first-rank journal devoted to that field, and not to philosophy,\\nthis is undeniable (see, e.g., Pollock 2001, 1992). This point is\\nimportant because while it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s certainly appropriate, in the\\npresent venue, to emphasize connections between AI and philosophy,\\nsome readers may suspect that this emphasis is contrived: they may\\nsuspect that the truth of the matter is that page after page of AI\\njournals are filled with narrow, technical content far from\\nphilosophy. Many such papers do exist. But we must distinguish between\\nwritings designed to present the nature of AI, and its core methods\\nand goals, versus writings designed to present progress on specific\\ntechnical issues. \\n\\nWritings in the latter category are more often than not quite narrow,\\nbut, as the example of Pollock shows, sometimes these specific issues\\nare inextricably linked to philosophy. And of course Pollock\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nwork is a representative example (albeit the most substantive one).\\nOne could just as easily have selected work by folks who don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nhappen to also produce straight philosophy. For example, for an entire\\nbook written within the confines of AI and computer science, but which\\nis epistemic logic in action in many ways, suitable for use in\\nseminars on that topic, see (Fagin et al. 2004). (It is hard to find\\ntechnical work that isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bound up with philosophy in some\\ndirect way. E.g., AI research on learning is all intimately bound up\\nwith philosophical treatments of induction, of how genuinely new\\nconcepts not simply defined in terms of prior ones can be learned. One\\npossible partial answer offered by AI is inductive logic\\nprogramming, discussed in Chapter 19 of AIMA.) \\n\\nWhat of writings in the former category? Writings in this category,\\nwhile by definition in AI venues, not philosophy ones, are nonetheless\\nphilosophical. Most textbooks include plenty of material that falls\\ninto this latter category, and hence they include discussion of the\\nphilosophical nature of AI (e.g., that AI is aimed at building\\nartificial intelligences, and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why, after all, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ncalled \\xe2\\x80\\x98AI\\xe2\\x80\\x99). \\n8. Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence\\n8.1 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrong\\xe2\\x80\\x9d versus \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWeak\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AI\\n\\nRecall that we earlier discussed proposed definitions of AI, and\\nrecall specifically that these proposals were couched in terms of the\\ngoals of the field. We can follow this pattern here: We can\\ndistinguish between \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrong\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWeak\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AI by\\ntaking note of the different goals that these two versions of AI\\nstrive to reach. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrong\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AI seeks to create artificial\\npersons: machines that have all the mental powers we have, including\\nphenomenal consciousness. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWeak\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AI, on the other hand,\\nseeks to build information-processing machines that appear to\\nhave the full mental repertoire of human persons (Searle 1997).\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWeak\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AI can also be defined as the form of AI that aims\\nat a system able to pass not just the Turing Test (again, abbreviated\\nas TT), but the Total Turing Test (Harnad 1991). In TTT, a\\nmachine must muster more than linguistic indistinguishability: it must\\npass for a human in all behaviors \\xe2\\x80\\x93 throwing a baseball, eating,\\nteaching a class, etc. \\n\\nIt would certainly seem to be exceedingly difficult for philosophers\\nto overthrow \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWeak\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AI (Bringsjord and Xiao 2000). After\\nall, what philosophical reason stands in the way of AI\\nproducing artifacts that appear to be animals or even humans?\\nHowever, some philosophers have aimed to do in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrong\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nAI, and we turn now to the most prominent case in point. \\n8.2 The Chinese Room Argument Against \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrong AI\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWithout question, the most famous argument in the philosophy of AI is\\nJohn Searle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s (1980) Chinese Room Argument (CRA), designed to\\noverthrow \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrong\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AI. We present a quick summary here and\\na \\xe2\\x80\\x9creport from the trenches\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as to how AI practitioners\\nregard the argument. Readers wanting to further study CRA will find an\\nexcellent next step in the entry on\\n the Chinese Room Argument\\n and (Bishop & Preston 2002). \\n\\nCRA is based on a thought-experiment in which Searle himself stars. He\\nis inside a room; outside the room are native Chinese speakers who\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know that Searle is inside it. Searle-in-the-box, like\\nSearle-in-real-life, doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know any Chinese, but is fluent in\\nEnglish. The Chinese speakers send cards into the room through a slot;\\non these cards are written questions in Chinese. The box, courtesy of\\nSearle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s secret work therein, returns cards to the native\\nChinese speakers as output. Searle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s output is produced by\\nconsulting a rulebook: this book is a lookup table that tells him what\\nChinese to produce based on what is sent in. To Searle, the Chinese is\\nall just a bunch of \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to use Searle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s language \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nsquiggle-squoggles. The following schematic picture sums up the\\nsituation. The labels should be obvious. \\\\(O\\\\) denotes the outside\\nobservers, in this case the Chinese speakers. Input is denoted by\\n\\\\(i\\\\) and output by \\\\(o\\\\). As you can see, there is an icon for the\\nrulebook, and Searle himself is denoted by \\\\(P\\\\).\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Chinese Room, Schematic View\\n\\n\\nNow, what is the argument based on this thought-experiment? Even if\\nyou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never heard of CRA before, you doubtless can see the\\nbasic idea: that Searle (in the box) is supposed to be everything a\\ncomputer can be, and because he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand Chinese, no\\ncomputer could have such understanding. Searle is mindlessly moving\\nsquiggle-squoggles around, and (according to the argument)\\nthat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all computers do,\\n fundamentally.[39]\\n\\nWhere does CRA stand today? As we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve already indicated, the\\nargument would still seem to be alive and well; witness (Bishop &\\nPreston 2002). However, there is little doubt that at least among AI\\npractitioners, CRA is generally rejected. (This is of course\\nthoroughly unsurprising.) Among these practitioners, the philosopher\\nwho has offered the most formidable response out of AI itself is\\nRapaport (1988), who argues that while AI systems are indeed\\nsyntactic, the right syntax can constitute semantics. It should be\\nsaid that a common attitude among proponents of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrong\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nAI is that CRA is not only unsound, but silly, based as it is on a\\nfanciful story (CR) far removed from the practice of AI\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 practice which is year by year moving ineluctably toward\\nsophisticated robots that will once and for all silence CRA and its\\nproponents. For example, John Pollock (as we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve noted,\\nphilosopher and practitioner of AI) writes: \\n\\nOnce [my intelligent system] OSCAR is fully functional, the argument\\nfrom analogy will lead us inexorably to attribute thoughts and\\nfeelings to OSCAR with precisely the same credentials with which we\\nattribute them to human beings. Philosophical arguments to the\\ncontrary will be pass\\xc3\\xa9. (Pollock 1995, p. 6)\\n\\n\\nTo wrap up discussion of CRA, we make two quick points, to wit: \\n\\n Despite the confidence of the likes of Pollock about the eventual\\nirrelevance of CRA in the face of the eventual human-level prowess of\\nOSCAR (and, by extension, any number of other still-improving AI\\nsystems), the brute fact is that deeply semantic natural-language\\nprocessing (NLP) is rarely even pursued these days, so proponents of\\nCRA are certainly not the ones feeling some discomfort in light of the\\ncurrent state of AI. In short, Searle would rightly point to any of\\nthe success stories of AI, including the Watson system we have\\ndiscussed, and still proclaim that understanding is nowhere to be\\nfound \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and he would be well within his philosophical rights in\\nsaying this. \\n It would appear that the CRA is bubbling back to a level of\\nengagement not seen for a number of years, in light of the empirical\\nfact that certain thinkers are now issuing explicit warnings to the\\neffect that future conscious, malevolent machines may well wish to do\\nin our species. In reply, Searle (2014) points out that since CRA is\\nsound, there can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be conscious machines; and if there\\ncan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be conscious machines, there can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be malevolent\\nmachines that wish anything. We return to this at the end of our\\nentry; the chief point here is that CRA continues to be quite\\nrelevant, and indeed we suspect that Searle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s basis for\\nhave-no-fear will be taken up energetically by not only philosophers,\\nbut AI experts, futurists, lawyers, and policy-makers. \\n\\n\\nReaders may wonder if there are philosophical debates that AI\\nresearchers engage in, in the course of working in their field (as\\nopposed to when they might attend a philosophy conference). Surely, AI\\nresearchers have philosophical discussions amongst themselves, right?\\n\\n\\nGenerally, one finds that AI researchers do discuss among themselves\\ntopics in philosophy of AI, and these topics are usually the very same\\nones that occupy philosophers of AI. However, the attitude reflected\\nin the quote from Pollock immediately above is by far the dominant\\none. That is, in general, the attitude of AI researchers is that\\nphilosophizing is sometimes fun, but the upward march of AI\\nengineering cannot be stopped, will not fail, and will eventually\\nrender such philosophizing otiose. \\n\\nWe will return to the issue of the future of AI in the\\n final section\\n of this entry. \\n8.3 The G\\xc3\\xb6delian Argument Against \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrong AI\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nFour decades ago, J.R. Lucas (1964) argued that G\\xc3\\xb6del\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nfirst incompleteness theorem entails that no machine can ever reach\\nhuman-level intelligence. His argument has not proved to be\\ncompelling, but Lucas initiated a debate that has produced more\\nformidable arguments. One of Lucas\\xe2\\x80\\x99 indefatigable defenders is\\nthe physicist Roger Penrose, whose first attempt to vindicate Lucas\\nwas a G\\xc3\\xb6delian attack on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrong\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AI articulated in\\nhis The Emperor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s New Mind (1989). This first attempt\\nfell short, and Penrose published a more elaborate and more fastidious\\nG\\xc3\\xb6delian case, expressed in Chapters 2 and 3 of his Shadows of\\nthe Mind (1994). \\n\\nIn light of the fact that readers can turn to the\\n entry on the G\\xc3\\xb6del\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Incompleteness Theorems,\\n a full review here is not needed. Instead, readers will be given a\\ndecent sense of the argument by turning to an online paper in which\\nPenrose, writing in response to critics (e.g., the philosopher David\\nChalmers, the logician Solomon Feferman, and the computer scientist\\nDrew McDermott) of his Shadows of the Mind, distills the\\nargument to a couple of\\n paragraphs.[40]\\n Indeed, in this paper Penrose gives what he takes to be the perfected\\nversion of the core G\\xc3\\xb6delian case given in SOTM. Here is\\nthis version, verbatim: \\n\\nWe try to suppose that the totality of methods of (unassailable)\\nmathematical reasoning that are in principle humanly accessible can be\\nencapsulated in some (not necessarily computational) sound formal\\nsystem \\\\(F\\\\). A human mathematician, if presented with \\\\(F\\\\), could\\nargue as follows (bearing in mind that the phrase \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am\\n\\\\(F\\\\)\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is merely a shorthand for \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\\\(F\\\\) encapsulates all\\nthe humanly accessible methods of mathematical proof\\xe2\\x80\\x9d):\\n\\n\\n(A) \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThough I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know that I necessarily am \\\\(F\\\\), I\\nconclude that if I were, then the system \\\\(F\\\\) would have to be sound\\nand, more to the point, \\\\(F'\\\\) would have to be sound, where \\\\(F'\\\\) is\\n\\\\(F\\\\) supplemented by the further assertion \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am \\\\(F\\\\).\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nI perceive that it follows from the assumption that I am \\\\(F\\\\) that\\nthe G\\xc3\\xb6del statement \\\\(G(F')\\\\) would have to be true and,\\nfurthermore, that it would not be a consequence of \\\\(F'\\\\). But I have\\njust perceived that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I happened to be \\\\(F\\\\), then \\\\(G(F')\\\\)\\nwould have to be true,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and perceptions of this nature would be\\nprecisely what \\\\(F'\\\\) is supposed to achieve. Since I am therefore\\ncapable of perceiving something beyond the powers of \\\\(F'\\\\), I deduce\\nthat I cannot be \\\\(F\\\\) after all. Moreover, this applies to any other\\n(G\\xc3\\xb6delizable) system, in place of \\\\(F\\\\).\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Penrose 1996,\\n3.2)\\n\\n\\n\\nDoes this argument succeed? A firm answer to this question is not\\nappropriate to seek in the present entry. Interested readers are\\nencouraged to consult four full-scale treatments of the argument\\n(LaForte et. al 1998; Bringsjord and Xiao 2000; Shapiro 2003; Bowie\\n1982).\\n8.4 Additional Topics and Readings in Philosophy of AI\\n\\nIn addition to the G\\xc3\\xb6delian and Searlean arguments covered\\nbriefly above, a third attack on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrong\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AI (of the\\nsymbolic variety) has been widely discussed (though with the rise of\\nstatistical machine learning has come a corresponding decrease in the\\nattention paid to it), namely, one given by the philosopher Hubert\\nDreyfus (1972, 1992), some incarnations of which have been\\nco-articulated with his brother, Stuart Dreyfus (1987), a computer\\nscientist. Put crudely, the core idea in this attack is that human\\nexpertise is not based on the explicit, disembodied, mechanical\\nmanipulation of symbolic information (such as formulae in some logic,\\nor probabilities in some Bayesian network), and that AI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nefforts to build machines with such expertise are doomed if based on\\nthe symbolic paradigm. The genesis of the Dreyfusian attack was a\\nbelief that the critique of (if you will) symbol-based philosophy\\n(e.g., philosophy in the logic-based, rationalist tradition, as\\nopposed to what is called the Continental tradition) from such\\nthinkers as Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty could be made against the\\nrationalist tradition in AI. After further reading and study of\\nDreyfus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 writings, readers may judge whether this critique is\\ncompelling, in an information-driven world increasingly managed by\\nintelligent agents that carry out symbolic reasoning (albeit not even\\nclose to the human level). \\n\\nFor readers interested in exploring philosophy of AI beyond what Jim\\nMoor (in a recent address \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Next Fifty Years of AI:\\nFuture Scientific Research vs. Past Philosophical Criticisms\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 as the 2006 Barwise Award winner at the annual eastern\\nAmerican Philosophical Association meeting) has called the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe\\nbig three\\xe2\\x80\\x9d criticisms of AI, there is no shortage of additional\\nmaterial, much of it available on the Web. The last chapter of\\nAIMA provides a compressed overview of some additional\\narguments against \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrong\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AI, and is in general not a bad\\nnext step. Needless to say, Philosophy of AI today involves much more\\nthan the three well-known arguments discussed above, and, inevitably,\\nPhilosophy of AI tomorrow will include new debates and problems we\\ncan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see now. Because machines, inevitably, will get smarter\\nand smarter (regardless of just how smart they get),\\nPhilosophy of AI, pure and simple, is a growth industry. With every\\nhuman activity that machines match, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbig\\xe2\\x80\\x9d questions\\nwill only attract more attention. \\n9. The Future\\n\\nIf past predictions are any indication, the only thing we know today\\nabout tomorrow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s science and technology is that it will be\\nradically different than whatever we predict it will be like.\\nArguably, in the case of AI, we may also specifically know today that\\nprogress will be much slower than what most expect. After all, at the\\n1956 kickoff conference (discussed at the start of this entry), Herb\\nSimon predicted that thinking machines able to match the human mind\\nwere \\xe2\\x80\\x9cjust around the corner\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (for the relevant quotes and\\ninformative discussion, see the first chapter of AIMA). As it\\nturned out, the new century would arrive without a single machine able\\nto converse at even the toddler level. (Recall that when it comes to\\nthe building of machines capable of displaying human-level\\nintelligence, Descartes, not Turing, seems today to be the better\\nprophet.) Nonetheless, astonishing though it may be, serious thinkers\\nin the late 20th century have continued to issue incredibly optimistic\\npredictions regarding the progress of AI. For example, Hans Moravec\\n(1999), in his Robot: Mere Machine to Transcendent Mind,\\ninforms us that because the speed of computer hardware doubles every\\n18 months (in accordance with Moore\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Law, which has\\napparently held in the past), \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfourth generation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nrobots will soon enough exceed humans in all respects, from running\\ncompanies to writing novels. These robots, so the story goes, will\\nevolve to such lofty cognitive heights that we will stand to them as\\nsingle-cell organisms stand to us\\n today.[41]\\n\\n\\nMoravec is by no means singularly Pollyannaish: Many others in AI\\npredict the same sensational future unfolding on about the same rapid\\nschedule. In fact, at the aforementioned AI@50 conference, Jim Moor\\nposed the question \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWill human-level AI be achieved within the\\nnext 50 years?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to five thinkers who attended the original 1956\\nconference: John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Oliver Selfridge, Ray\\nSolomonoff, and Trenchard Moore. McCarthy and Minsky gave firm,\\nunhesitating affirmatives, and Solomonoff seemed to suggest that AI\\nprovided the one ray of hope in the face of fact that our species\\nseems bent on destroying itself. (Selfridge\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reply was a bit\\ncryptic. Moore returned a firm, unambiguous negative, and declared\\nthat once his computer is smart enough to interact with him\\nconversationally about mathematical problems, he might take this whole\\nenterprise more seriously.) It is left to the reader to judge the\\naccuracy of such risky predictions as have been given by Moravec,\\nMcCarthy, and\\n Minsky.[42]\\n\\n\\nThe judgment of the reader in this regard ought to factor in the\\nstunning resurgence, very recently, of serious reflection on what is\\nknown as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Singularity,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (denoted by us simply as\\nS) the future point at which artificial intelligence exceeds\\nhuman intelligence, whereupon immediately thereafter (as the story\\ngoes) the machines make themselves rapidly smarter and smarter and\\nsmarter, reaching a superhuman level of intelligence that, stuck as we\\nare in the mud of our limited mentation, we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fathom. For\\nextensive, balanced analysis of S, see Eden et al. (2013).\\n\\nReaders unfamiliar with the literature on S may be quite\\nsurprised to learn the degree to which, among learned folks, this\\nhypothetical event is not only taken seriously, but has in fact become\\na target for extensive and frequent philosophizing [for a mordant tour\\nof the recent thought in question, see Floridi (2015)]. What\\narguments support the belief that S is in our future?\\nThere are two main arguments at this point: the familiar\\nhardware-based one [championed by Moravec, as noted above, and again\\nmore recently by Kurzweil (2006)]; and the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 as far as we know\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 original argument given by mathematician I. J. Good (1965). In\\naddition, there is a recent and related doomsayer argument advanced by\\nBostrom (2014), which seems to presuppose that S will occur.\\nGood\\xe2\\x80\\x99s argument, nicely amplified and adjusted by Chalmers\\n(2010), who affirms the tidied-up version of the argument, runs as\\nfollows:\\n\\nPremise 1: There will be AI (created by HI and such that AI\\n= HI). \\nPremise 2: If there is AI, there will be AI\\\\(^+\\\\) (created\\nby AI). \\nPremise 3: If there is AI\\\\(^+\\\\), there will be AI\\\\(^{++}\\\\)\\n(created by AI\\\\(^+\\\\)). \\nConclusion: There will be AI\\\\(^{++}\\\\) (= S will\\noccur). \\n\\n\\nIn this argument, \\xe2\\x80\\x98AI\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is artificial intelligence at the\\nlevel of, and created by, human persons, \\xe2\\x80\\x98AI\\\\(^+\\\\)\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nartificial intelligence above the level of human persons, and\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98AI\\\\(^{++}\\\\)\\xe2\\x80\\x99 super-intelligence constitutive of S.\\nThe key process is presumably the creation of one class of\\nmachine by another. We have added for convenience \\xe2\\x80\\x98HI\\xe2\\x80\\x99 for\\nhuman intelligence; the central idea is then: HI will create AI, the\\nlatter at the same level of intelligence as the former; AI will create\\nAI\\\\(^+\\\\); AI\\\\(^+\\\\) will create AI\\\\(^{++}\\\\); with the ascension\\nproceeding perhaps forever, but at any rate proceeding long enough for\\nus to be as ants outstripped by gods. \\n\\nThe argument certainly appears to be formally valid. Are its three\\npremises true? Taking up such a question would fling us far beyond the\\nscope of this entry. We point out only that the concept of one class\\nof machines creating another, more powerful class of machines is not a\\ntransparent one, and neither Good nor Chalmers provides a rigorous\\naccount of the concept, which is ripe for philosophical analysis. (As\\nto mathematical analysis, some exists, of course. It is for example\\nwell-known that a computing machine at level \\\\(L\\\\) cannot possibly\\ncreate another machine at a higher level \\\\(L'\\\\). For instance, a\\nlinear-bounded automaton can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t create a Turing machine.)\\n\\nThe Good-Chalmers argument has a rather clinical air about it; the\\nargument doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say anything regarding whether machines in\\nthe AI\\\\(^{++}\\\\) category will be benign, malicious, or munificent.\\nMany others gladly fill this gap with dark, dark pessimism. The\\nlocus classicus here is without question a widely read paper by\\nBill Joy (2000): \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy The Future Doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t Need Us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nJoy believes that the human race is doomed, in no small part because\\nit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s busy building smart machines. He writes: \\n\\n\\nThe 21st-century technologies \\xe2\\x80\\x93 genetics, nanotechnology, and\\nrobotics (GNR) \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are so powerful that they can spawn whole new\\nclasses of accidents and abuses. Most dangerously, for the first time,\\nthese accidents and abuses are widely within the reach of individuals\\nor small groups. They will not require large facilities or rare raw\\nmaterials. Knowledge alone will enable the use of them.\\n\\nThus we have the possibility not just of weapons of mass destruction\\nbut of knowledge-enabled mass destruction (KMD), this destructiveness\\nhugely amplified by the power of self-replication. \\n\\nI think it is no exaggeration to say we are on the cusp of the further\\nperfection of extreme evil, an evil whose possibility spreads well\\nbeyond that which weapons of mass destruction bequeathed to the\\nnation-states, on to a surprising and terrible empowerment of extreme\\n individuals.[43]\\n\\n\\n\\nPhilosophers would be most interested in arguments for this\\nview. What are Joy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s? Well, no small reason for the attention\\nlavished on his paper is that, like Raymond Kurzweil (2000), Joy\\nrelies heavily on an argument given by none other than the Unabomber\\n(Theodore Kaczynski). The idea is that, assuming we succeed in\\nbuilding intelligent machines, we will have them do most (if not all)\\nwork for us. If we further allow the machines to make decisions for us\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 even if we retain oversight over the machines \\xe2\\x80\\x93, we will\\neventually depend on them to the point where we must simply accept\\ntheir decisions. But even if we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t allow the machines to make\\ndecisions, the control of such machines is likely to be held by a\\nsmall elite who will view the rest of humanity as unnecessary \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nsince the machines can do any needed work (Joy 2000).\\n\\nThis isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the place to assess this argument. (Having said that,\\nthe pattern pushed by the Unabomber and his supporters certainly\\nappears to be flatly\\n invalid.[44])\\n In fact, many readers will doubtless feel that no such place exists\\nor will exist, because the reasoning here is amateurish. So then, what\\nabout the reasoning of professional philosophers on the matter? \\n\\nBostrom has recently painted an exceedingly dark picture of a possible\\nfuture. He points out that the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfirst superintelligence\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\ncould have the capability\\n\\nto shape the future of Earth-originating life, could easily have\\nnon-anthropomorphic final goals, and would likely have instrumental\\nreasons to pursue open-ended resource acquisition. If we now reflect\\nthat human beings consist of useful resources (such as conveniently\\nlocated atoms) and that we depend on many more local resources, we can\\nsee that the outcome could easily be one in which humanity quickly\\nbecomes extinct. (Bostrom 2014, p. 416)\\n\\n\\n Clearly, the most vulnerable premise in this sort of argument\\nis that the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfirst superintelligence\\xe2\\x80\\x9d will arrive indeed\\narrive. Here perhaps the Good-Chalmers argument provides a basis.\\n\\n\\nSearle (2014) thinks Bostrom\\xe2\\x80\\x99s book is misguided and\\nfundamentally mistaken, and that we needn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry. His rationale\\nis dirt-simple: Machines aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t conscious; Bostrom is alarmed at\\nthe prospect of malicious machines who do us in; a malicious machine\\nis by definition a conscious machine; ergo, Bostrom\\xe2\\x80\\x99s argument\\ndoesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work. Searle writes: \\n\\nIf the computer can fly airplanes, drive cars, and win at chess, who\\ncares if it is totally nonconscious? But if we are worried about a\\nmaliciously motivated superintelligence destroying us, then it is\\nimportant that the malicious motivation should be real. Without\\nconsciousness, there is no possibiity of its being real.\\n\\n\\nThe positively remarkable thing here, it seems to us, is that Searle\\nappears to be unaware of the brute fact that most AI engineers are\\nperfectly content to build machines on the basis of the AIMA\\nview of AI we presented and explained above: the view according to\\nwhich machines simply map percepts to actions. On this view, it\\ndoesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t matter whether the machine really has desires;\\nwhat matters is whether it acts suitably on the basis of how AI\\nscientists engineer formal correlates to desire. An\\nautonomous machine with overwhelming destructive power that\\nnon-consciously \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdecides\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to kill doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t become\\njust a nuisance because genuine, human-level, subjective desire is\\nabsent from the machine. If an AI can play the game of chess, and the\\ngame of Jeopardy!, it can certainly play the game of war. Just\\nas it does little good for a human loser to point out that the\\nvictorious machine in a game of chess isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t conscious, it will\\ndo little good for humans being killed by machines to point out that\\nthese machines aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t conscious. (It is interesting to note that\\nthe genesis of Joy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s paper was an informal conversation with\\nJohn Searle and Raymond Kurzweil. According to Joy, Searle\\ndidn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think there was much to worry about, since he was (and\\nis) quite confident that tomorrow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s robots can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be\\n conscious.[45])\\n \\n\\nThere are some things we can safely say about tomorrow.\\nCertainly, barring some cataclysmic events (nuclear or biological\\nwarfare, global economic depression, a meteorite smashing into Earth,\\netc.), we now know that AI will succeed in producing artificial\\nanimals. Since even some natural animals (mules, e.g.) can be\\neasily trained to work for humans, it stands to reason that artificial\\nanimals, designed from scratch with our purposes in mind, will be\\ndeployed to work for us. In fact, many jobs currently done by humans\\nwill certainly be done by appropriately programmed artificial animals.\\nTo pick an arbitrary example, it is difficult to believe that\\ncommercial drivers won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be artificial in the future. (Indeed,\\nDaimler is already running commercials in which they tout the ability\\nof their automobiles to drive \\xe2\\x80\\x9cautonomously,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d allowing\\nhuman occupants of these vehicles to ignore the road and read.) Other\\nexamples would include: cleaners, mail carriers, clerical workers,\\nmilitary scouts, surgeons, and pilots. (As to cleaners, probably a\\nsignificant number of readers, at this very moment, have robots from\\niRobot cleaning the carpets in their homes.) It is hard to see how\\nsuch jobs are inseparably bound up with the attributes often taken to\\nbe at the core of personhood \\xe2\\x80\\x93 attributes that would be the most\\ndifficult for AI to\\n replicate.[46]\\n\\n\\nAndy Clark (2003) has another prediction: Humans will gradually\\nbecome, at least to an appreciable degree, cyborgs, courtesy of\\nartificial limbs and sense organs, and implants. The main driver of\\nthis trend will be that while standalone AIs are often desirable, they\\nare hard to engineer when the desired level of intelligence is high.\\nBut to let humans \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpilot\\xe2\\x80\\x9d less intelligent machines is a\\ngood deal easier, and still very attractive for concrete reasons.\\nAnother related prediction is that AI would play the role of a\\ncognitive prosthesis for humans (Ford et al. 1997; Hoffman et al.\\n2001). The prosthesis view sees AI as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreat equalizer\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nthat would lead to less stratification in society, perhaps similar to\\nhow the Hindu-Arabic numeral system made arithmetic available to the\\nmasses, and to how the Guttenberg press contributed to literacy\\nbecoming more universal. \\n\\nEven if the argument is formally invalid, it leaves us with a question\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 the cornerstone question about AI and the future: Will AI\\nproduce artificial creatures that replicate and exceed human cognition\\n(as Kurzweil and Joy believe)? Or is this merely an interesting\\nsupposition? \\n\\nThis is a question not just for scientists and engineers; it is also a\\nquestion for philosophers. This is so for two reasons. One, research\\nand development designed to validate an affirmative answer must\\ninclude philosophy \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for reasons rooted in earlier parts of the\\npresent entry. (E.g., philosophy is the place to turn to for robust\\nformalisms to model human propositional attitudes in machine terms.)\\nTwo, philosophers might well be able to provide arguments that answer\\nthe cornerstone question now, definitively. If a version of either of\\nthe three arguments against \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrong\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AI alluded to above\\n(Searle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s CRA; the G\\xc3\\xb6delian attack; the Dreyfus argument)\\nare sound, then of course AI will not manage to produce machines\\nhaving the mental powers of persons. No doubt the future holds not\\nonly ever-smarter machines, but new arguments pro and con on the\\nquestion of whether this progress can reach the human level that\\nDescartes declared to be unreachable. \\n\\n\\nBibliography\\n\\n Adams, E.

Thanks to the arrival of super-cheap computer chips and the ubiquity of wireless networks, it\\'s possible to turn anything, from something as small as\\xc2\\xa0a pill to something as big as\\xc2\\xa0an aeroplane, into a part of the IoT. Connecting up all these different objects and adding sensors to them adds a level of digital intelligence to devices that would be otherwise dumb, enabling them to communicate real-time data without involving a human being. The Internet of Things is making the fabric of the world around us more smarter and more responsive, merging the digital and physical universes. The Internet of Things? It\\'s really a giant robot and we don\\'t know how to fix it What is an example of an Internet of Things device? Pretty much any physical object can be transformed into an IoT device if it can be connected to the internet to be controlled or communicate information.  A lightbulb that can be switched on using a smartphone app is an IoT device, as is a motion sensor or a smart thermostat in your office or a connected streetlight. An IoT device could be as fluffy as a child\\'s toy or as serious as\\xc2\\xa0a driverless truck. Some larger objects may themselves be filled with many smaller IoT components, such as a jet engine that\\'s now filled with thousands of sensors collecting and transmitting data back to make sure it is operating efficiently. At an even bigger scale, smart cities projects are filling entire regions with sensors to help us understand and control the environment.\\xc2\\xa0 \\n\\n\\nSEE: 5G: What it means for IoT (ZDNet/TechRepublic special feature) | Download the free PDF version (TechRepublic)The term IoT is mainly used for devices that wouldn\\'t usually be generally expected to have an internet connection, and that can communicate with the network independently of human action. For this reason, a PC isn\\'t generally considered an IoT device and neither is a smartphone -- even though the latter is crammed with sensors. A smartwatch or a fitness band or other wearable device might be counted as an IoT device, however. Google and Levi\\'s unveil internet-connected jacket\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the history of the Internet of Things? The idea of adding sensors and intelligence to basic objects was discussed throughout the 1980s and 1990s (and there are arguably some much earlier ancestors), but apart from some early projects -- including an internet-connected vending machine -- progress was slow simply because the technology wasn\\'t ready. Chips were too big and bulky and there was no way for objects to communicate effectively. Processors that were cheap and power-frugal enough to be all but disposable were needed before it finally became cost-effective to connect up billions of devices. The adoption of RFID tags -- low-power chips that can communicate wirelessly -- solved some of this issue, along with the increasing availability of broadband internet and cellular and wireless networking. The adoption of IPv6 -- which, among other things, should provide enough IP addresses for every device the world (or indeed this galaxy) is ever likely to need -- was also a necessary step for the IoT to scale.\\xc2\\xa0 Kevin Ashton coined the phrase \\'Internet of Things\\' in 1999, although it took at least another decade for the technology to catch up with the vision.  \"The IoT integrates the interconnectedness of human culture -- our \\'things\\' -- with the interconnectedness of our digital information system -- \\'the internet.\\' That\\'s the IoT,\" Ashton told ZDNet. Adding RFID tags to expensive pieces of equipment to help track their location was one of the first IoT applications. But since then, the cost of adding sensors and an internet connection to objects has continued to fall, and experts predict that this basic functionality could one day cost as little as 10 cents, making it possible to connect nearly everything to the internet. The IoT was initially most interesting to business and manufacturing, where its application is sometimes known as machine-to-machine (M2M), but the emphasis is now on filling our homes and offices with smart devices, transforming it into something that\\'s relevant to almost everyone. Early suggestions for internet-connected devices included \\'blogjects\\' (objects that blog and record data about themselves to the internet), ubiquitous computing (or \\'ubicomp\\'), invisible computing, and pervasive computing. However, it was Internet of Things and IoT that stuck. If you want to succeed you must fail first, says the man who dreamt up the Internet of ThingsHow big is the Internet of Things? Big and getting bigger -- there are already more connected things than people in the world. Tech analyst company IDC predicts that in total there will be 41.6 billion connected IoT devices by 2025, or \"things.\" It also suggests industrial and automotive equipment represent the largest opportunity of connected \"things,\", but it also sees strong adoption of smart home and wearable devices in the near term. \\xc2\\xa0 Another tech analyst, Gartner, predicts that the enterprise and automotive sectors will account for 5.8 billion devices this year, up almost a quarter on 2019. Utilities will be the highest user of IoT, thanks to the continuing rollout of smart meters. Security devices, in the form of intruder detection and web cameras will be the second biggest use of IoT devices. Building automation \\xe2\\x80\\x93 like connected lighting \\xe2\\x80\\x93 will be the fastest growing sector, followed by automotive (connected cars) and healthcare (monitoring of chronic conditions).\\xc2\\xa0 \\n                                                    Image: Gartner\\n                                                What are the benefits of the Internet of Things for business? The benefits of the IoT for business depend on the particular implementation; agility and efficiency are usually top considerations. The idea is that enterprises should have access to more data about their own products and their own internal systems, and a greater ability to make changes as a result. See also: How SMBs can maximize the benefits of IoT initiatives Manufacturers are adding sensors to the components of their products so that they can transmit data back about how they are performing. This can help companies spot when a component is likely to fail and to swap it out before it causes damage. Companies can also use the data generated by these sensors to make their systems and their supply chains more efficient, because they will have much more accurate data about what\\'s really going on. \\n\\n\\nSpecial Feature\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                        Special report: 5G: What it means for IoT (free PDF)\\n                    \\n\\nThis ebook, based on the latest ZDNet / TechRepublic special feature, examines how 5G connectivity will underpin the next generation of IoT devices.\\n\\nRead More\\n\\n\\n\"With the introduction of comprehensive, real-time data collection and analysis, production systems can become dramatically more responsive,\" say consultants McKinsey.Enterprise use of the IoT can be divided into two segments: industry-specific offerings like sensors in a generating plant or real-time location devices for healthcare; and IoT devices that can be used in all industries, like smart air conditioning or security systems. While industry-specific products will make the early running, by 2020 Gartner predicts that cross-industry devices will reach 4.4 billion units, while vertical-specific devices will amount to 3.2 billion units. Consumers purchase more devices, but businesses spend more: the analyst group said that while consumer spending on IoT devices was around $725bn last year, businesses spending on IoT hit $964bn. By 2020, business and consumer spending on IoT hardware will hit nearly $3tn. \\n                                                    Image: IDC\\n                                                Worldwide spending on the IoT was forecast to reach $745 billion in 2019, an increase of 15.4% over the $646 billion spent in 2018, according to IDC, and pass the $1 trillion mark in 2022. Top industries for the IoT were predicted to be discrete manufacturing ($119 billion in spending), process manufacturing ($78 billion), transportation ($71 billion), and utilities ($61 billion). For manufacturers, projects to support asset management will be key; in transportation it will be freight monitoring and fleet management taking top priority. IoT spending in the utilities industry will be dominated by smart-grid projects for electricity, gas, and water. Consumer IoT spending was predicted to hit $108 billion, making it the second largest industry segment: smart home, personal wellness, and connected vehicle infotainment will see much of the spending.  By use case, manufacturing operations ($100 billion), production asset management ($44.2 billion), smart home ($44.1 billion), and freight monitoring ($41.7 billion) will be the largest areas of investment.\\xc2\\xa0 UX needs to operate under a new set of rules within the Internet of ThingsDo you own your data and have free rein? The answer in an Internet of things, cloud world may surprise youWhat is the Industrial Internet of Things? The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) or the fourth industrial revolution or Industry 4.0 are all names given to the use of IoT technology in a business setting. The concept is the same as for the consumer IoT devices in the home, but in this case the aim is to use a combination of sensors, wireless networks, big data, AI and analytics to measure and optimise industrial processes.\\xc2\\xa0 If introduced across an entire supply chain, rather than just individual companies, the impact could be even greater with just-in-time delivery of materials and the management of production from start to finish. Increasing workforce productivity or cost savings are two potential aims, but the IIoT can also create new revenue streams for businesses; rather than just selling a standalone product \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for example, like an engine \\xe2\\x80\\x93 manufacturers can also sell predictive maintenance of the engine.\\xc2\\xa0 What are the benefits of the Internet of Things for consumers? The IoT promises to make our environment -- our homes and offices and vehicles -- smarter, more measurable, and... chattier. Smart speakers like Amazon\\'s Echo and Google Home make it easier to play music, set timers, or get information. Home security systems make it easier to monitor what\\'s going on inside and outside, or to see and talk to visitors. Meanwhile, smart thermostats can help us heat our homes before we arrive back, and smart lightbulbs can make it look like we\\'re home even when we\\'re out.  Looking beyond the home, sensors can help us to understand how noisy or polluted our environment might be. Self-driving cars and smart cities could change how we build and manage our public spaces.  However, many of these innovations could have major implications for our personal privacy. Hive thinks it knows how to get the smart home buzzingThe Internet of Things and smart homes The House that Alexa Built: An Amazon showcase in London in 2017. \\n                                                    Image: Steve Ranger/ZDNet\\n                                                For consumers, the smart home is probably where they are likely to come into contact with internet-enabled things, and it\\'s one area where the big tech companies (in particular Amazon, Google, and Apple) are competing hard.  The most obvious of these are smart speakers like Amazon\\'s Echo, but there are also smart plugs, lightbulbs, cameras, thermostats, and the much-mocked smart fridge. But as well as showing off your enthusiasm for shiny new gadgets, there\\'s a more serious side to smart home applications. They may be able to help keep older people independent and in their own homes longer by making it easier for family and carers to communicate with them and monitor how they are getting on. A better understanding of how our homes operate, and the ability to tweak those settings, could help save energy -- by cutting heating costs, for example. Qualcomm: Mesh networking is the future of smart homesWhat about Internet of Things security? Security is one the biggest issues with the IoT. These sensors are collecting in many cases extremely sensitive data -- what you say and do in your own home, for example. Keeping that secure is vital to consumer trust, but so far the IoT\\'s security track record has been extremely poor. Too many IoT devices give little thought to the basics of security, like encrypting data in transit and at rest. Flaws in software -- even old and well-used code -- are discovered on a regular basis, but many IoT devices lack the capability to be patched, which means they are permanently at risk. Hackers are now actively targeting IoT devices such as routers and webcams because their inherent lack of security makes them easy to compromise and roll up into giant botnets. Flaws have left smart home devices like refrigerators, ovens, and dishwashers open to hackers. Researchers found 100,000 webcams that could be hacked with ease, while some internet-connected smartwatches for children have been found to contain security vulnerabilities that allow hackers to track the wearer\\'s location, eavesdrop on conversations, or even communicate with the user. Governments are growing worried about the risks here. The UK government has published its own guidelines around the security of consumer IoT devices. It expects devices to have unique passwords, that companies will provide a public point of contact so anyone can report a vulnerability (and that these will be acted on), and that manufacturers will explicitly state how long devices will get security updates. It\\'s a modest list, but a start.\\xc2\\xa0 When the cost of making smart objects becomes negligible, these problems will only become more widespread and intractable. All of this applies in business as well, but the stakes are even higher. Connecting industrial machinery to IoT networks increases the potential risk of hackers discovering and attacking these devices. Industrial espionage or a destructive attack on critical infrastructure are both potential risks. That means businesses will need to make sure that these networks are isolated and protected, with data encryption with security of sensors, gateways and other components a necessity. The current state of IoT technology makes that harder to ensure, however, as does a lack of consistent IoT security planning across organisations. That\\'s very worrying considering the documented willingness of hackers to tamper with industrial systems that have been connected to the internet but left unprotected. The IoT bridges the gap between the digital world and the physical world, which means that hacking into devices can have dangerous real-world consequences. Hacking into the sensors controlling the temperature in a power station could trick the operators into making a catastrophic decision; taking control of a driverless car could also end in disaster. Your forgotten IoT gadgets will leave a disastrous, toxic legacySecurity flaw in LG IoT software left home appliances vulnerableFive pitfalls to avoid in mobile and IoT securityFear the Reaper? Experts reassess the botnet\\'s size and firepowerInternet of Things security: What happens when every device is smart and you don\\'t even know it?What about privacy and the Internet of Things? With all those sensors collecting data on everything you do, the IoT is a potentially vast privacy and security headache. Take the smart home: it can tell when you wake up (when the smart coffee machine is activated) and how well you brush your teeth (thanks to your smart toothbrush), what radio station you listen to (thanks to your smart speaker), what type of food you eat (thanks to your smart oven or fridge), what your children think (thanks to their smart toys), and who visits you and passes by your house (thanks to your smart doorbell). While companies will make money from selling you the smart object in the first place, their IoT business model probably involves selling at least some of that data, too. What happens to that data is a vitally important privacy matter. Not all smart home companies build their business model around harvesting and selling your data, but some do.  And it\\'s worth remembering that IoT data can be combined with other bits of data to create a surprisingly detailed picture of you. It\\'s surprisingly easy to find out a lot about a person from a few different sensor readings. In one project, a researcher found that by analysing data charting just the home\\'s energy consumption, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide levels, temperature, and humidity throughout the day they could work out what someone was having for dinner. IoT devices are an enterprise security time bombI know what you ate last supper: What home sensors will reveal about your lifeInternet of Things security woes: Can smarter consumers save the IoT from disaster?IoT, privacy and business Consumers need to understand the exchange they are making and whether they are happy with that. Some of the same issues apply to business: would your executive team be happy to discuss a merger in a meeting room equipped with smart speakers and cameras, for example? One recent survey found that four out of five companies would be unable to identify all the IoT devices on their network.  Badly installed IoT products could easily open up corporate networks to attack by hackers, or simply leak data. It might seem like a trivial threat but imagine if the smart locks at your office refused to open one morning or the smart weather station in the CEO\\'s office was used by hackers to create a backdoor into your network. The spy on the corner of your desk: Why the smart office is your next security nightmareYour forgotten IoT gadgets will leave a disastrous, toxic legacyIoT in the office: Everything you need to know about the Internet of Things in the workplace\\xc2\\xa0The IoT and cyberwarfare The IoT makes computing physical. So if things go wrong with IoT devices, there can be major real-world consequences -- something that nations planning their cyberwarfare strategies are now taking into account.  US intelligence community briefings have warned that the country\\'s adversaries already have the ability to threaten its critical infrastructure as well \"as the broader ecosystem of connected consumer and industrial devices known as the Internet of Things\". US intelligence has also warned that connected thermostats, cameras, and cookers could all be used either to spy on citizens of another country, or to cause havoc if they were hacked. Adding key elements of national critical infrastructure (like dams, bridges, and elements of the electricity grid) to the IoT makes it even more vital that security is as tight as possible. Cyberwar: A guide to the frightening future of online conflictCyberwarfare comes of age: The internet is now officially a battlefieldYes, your smart toaster really will be spying on you for the governmentThe Internet of Things and data An IoT device will likely contain one or more sensors which it will use to collect data. Just what those sensors are collecting will depend on the individual device and its task. Sensors inside industrial machinery might measure temperature or pressure; a security camera might have a proximity sensor along with sound and video, while your home weather station will probably be packing a humidity sensor. All this sensor data \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and much, much more \\xe2\\x80\\x93 will have to be sent somewhere. That means IoT devices will need to transmit data and will do it via Wi-Fi, 4G, 5G and more. Tech analyst IDC calculates that within five years IoT gadgets will be creating 79.4 zettabytes of data. Some of this IoT data will be \"small and bursty\" says IDC \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a quick update like a temperature reading from a sensor or a reading from a smart meter. Other devices might create huge amounts of data traffic, like a video surveillance camera using computer vision. IDC said the amount of data created by IoT devices will grow rapidly in the next few years. Most of the data is being generated by video surveillance, it said, but other industrial and medical uses will generate more data over time. It said drones will also be a big driver of data creation using cameras. Looking further out, self-driving cars will also generate vast amounts of rich sensor data including audio and video, as well as more specialised automotive sensor data. Internet of Things and big data analytics The IoT generates vast amounts of data: from sensors attached to machine parts or environment sensors, or the words we shout at our smart speakers. That means the IoT is a significant driver of big-data analytics projects because it allows companies to create vast data sets and analyse them. Giving a manufacturer vast amounts of data about how its components behave in real-world situations can help them to make improvements much more rapidly, while data culled from sensors around a city could help planners make traffic flow more efficiently.  That data will come in many different forms \\xe2\\x80\\x93 voice requests, video, temperature or other sensor readings, all of which can be mined for insight. As analyst IDC notes, IoT metadata category is a growing source of data to be managed and leveraged. \"Metadata is a prime candidate to be fed into NoSQL databases like MongoDB to bring structure to unstructured content or fed into cognitive systems to bring new levels of understanding, intelligence, and order to outwardly random environments,\" it said. In particular, the IoT will deliver large amounts of real-time data. Cisco calculates that machine-to machine connections that support IoT applications will account for more than half of the total 27.1 billion devices and connections, and will account for 5% of global IP traffic by 2021.

Cloud computing giants are already courting these companies: Microsoft has its Azure IoT suite, while Amazon Web Services provides a range of IoT services, as does Google Cloud.

As a result, smart cities projects are a key feature of the IoT. Cities already generate large amounts of data (from security cameras and environmental sensors) and already contain big infrastructure networks (like those controlling traffic lights). IoT projects aim to connect these up, and then add further intelligence into the system. There are plans to blanket Spain\\'s Balearic Islands with half a million sensors and turn it into a lab for IoT projects, for example. One scheme could involve the regional social-services department using the sensors to help the elderly, while another could identify if a beach has become too crowded and offer alternatives to swimmers. In another example, AT&T is launching a service to monitor infrastructure such as bridges, roadways, and railways with LTE-enabled sensors to monitor structural changes such as cracks and tilts. The ability to better understand how a city is functioning should allow planners to make changes and monitor how this improves residents\\' lives. Big tech companies see smart cities projects as a potentially huge area, and many -- including mobile operators and networking companies -- are now positioning themselves to get involved.

IoT devices use a variety of methods to connect and share data, although most will use some form of wireless connectivity: homes and offices will use standard Wi-Fi, Zigbee or Bluetooth Low Energy (or even Ethernet if they aren\\'t especially mobile); other devices will use LTE (existing technologies include Narrowband IoT and LTE-M, largely aimed at small devices sending limited amounts of data) or even satellite connections to communicate. However, the vast number of different options has already led some to argue that IoT communications standards need to be as accepted and interoperable as Wi-Fi is today.\\xc2\\xa0 One area of growth in the next few years will undoubtedly be the use of 5G networks to support IoT projects. 5G offers the ability to fit as many as one million 5G devices in a square kilometre, which means that it will be possible to use a vast number of sensors in a very small area, making large-scale industrial IoT deployments more possible. The UK has just started a trial of 5G and the IoT at two \\'smart factories\\'. However, it could be some time before 5G deployments are widespread: Ericsson predicts that there will be somewhere around five billion IoT devices connected to cellular networks\\xc2\\xa0by 2025, but only around a quarter of those will be broadband IoT, with 4G connecting the majority of those. Outdoor surveillance cameras will be the largest market for 5G IoT devices in the near term, according to Gartner, accounting for the majority (70%) of the 5G IoT devices this year, before dropping to around 30% by the end of 2023, at which point they will be overtaken by connected cars. \\n                                                    Image: Gartner\\n                                                The analyst firm predicts that there will be 3.5 million 5G IoT devices in use this year, and nearly 50 million by 2023. Longer term the automotive industry will be the largest sector for 5G IoT use cases, it predicted. One likely trend is that, as the IoT develops, it could be that less data will be sent for processing in the cloud. To keep costs down, more processing could be done on-device with only the useful data sent back to the cloud \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a strategy known as  \\'edge computing\\'. This will require new technology \\xe2\\x80\\x93 like tamper-proof edge servers that can collect and analyse data far from the cloud or corporate data center. All your IoT devices are doomedEdge, core, and cloud: Where all the workloads go5G and the IoT: The UK\\'s first smart factory just switched on IoT data and artificial intelligence IoT devices generate vast amounts of data; that might be information about an engine\\'s temperature or whether a door is open or closed or the reading from a smart meter. All this IoT data has to be collected, stored and analysed. One way companies are making the most of this data is to feed it into artificial intelligence (AI) systems that will take that IoT data and use it to make predictions.  For example, Google has put an AI in charge of its data centre cooling system. The AI uses data pulled from thousands of IoT sensors, which is fed into deep neural networks, and which predict how different choices will affect future energy consumption. By using machine learning and AI, Google has been able to make its data centres more efficient and said the same technology could have uses in other industrial settings. Google just put an AI in charge of keeping its data centres coolIoT evolution: Where does the Internet of Things go next? As the price of sensors and communications continue to drop, it becomes cost-effective to add more devices to the IoT \\xe2\\x80\\x93 even if in some cases there\\'s little obvious benefit to consumers. Deployments are at an early stage; most companies that are engaging with the IoT are at the trial stage right now, largely because the necessary technology \\xe2\\x80\\x93 sensor technology, 5G and machine-learning powered analytics \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are still themselves at a reasonably early stage of development. There are many competing platforms and standards and many different vendors, from device makers to software companies to network operators, want a slice of the pie. It\\'s still not clear which of those will win out. But without standards, and with security an ongoing issue, we are likely to see some more big IoT security mishaps in the next few years. As the number of connected devices continues to rise, our living and working environments will become filled with smart products \\xe2\\x80\\x93 assuming we are willing to accept the security and privacy trade-offs. Some will welcome the new era of smart things. Others will pine for the days when a chair was simply a chair.

Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition and machine vision.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAI programming focuses on three cognitive skills: learning, reasoning and self-correction.\\nLearning processes. This aspect of AI programming focuses on acquiring data and creating rules for how to turn the data into actionable information. The rules, which are called algorithms, provide computing devices with step-by-step instructions for how to complete a specific task.\\nReasoning processes. This aspect of AI programming focuses on choosing the right algorithm to reach a desired outcome.\\nSelf-correction processes. This aspect of AI programming is designed to continually fine-tune algorithms and ensure they provide the most accurate results possible.\\n\\nAdvantages and disadvantages of artificial intelligence\\nArtificial neural networks and deep learning artificial intelligence technologies are quickly evolving, primarily because AI processes large amounts of data much faster and makes predictions more accurately than humanly possible.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis article is part of\\nUltimate guide to artificial intelligence in the enterprise\\n\\nWhich also includes:\\n4 main types of AI explained\\n6 key benefits of AI for business\\nCriteria for success in AI: Industry best practices\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDownload1\\nDownload this entire guide for FREE now!\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile the huge volume of data being created on a daily basis would bury a human researcher, AI applications that use machine learning can take that data and quickly turn it into actionable information. As of this writing, the primary disadvantage of using AI is that it is expensive to process the large amounts of data that AI programming requires.\\n\\n\\n\\nStrong AI vs. weak AI\\nAI can be categorized as either weak or strong. Weak AI, also known as narrow AI, is an AI system that is designed and trained to complete a specific task. Industrial robots and virtual personal assistants, such as Apple\\'s Siri, use weak AI.\\nStrong AI, also known as artificial general intelligence (AGI), describes programming that can replicate the cognitive abilities of the human brain. When presented with an unfamiliar task, a strong AI system can use fuzzy logic to apply knowledge from one domain to another and find a solution autonomously. In theory, a strong AI program should be able to pass both a Turing test and the Chinese room test.\\n\\n\\nAugmented intelligence vs. artificial intelligence\\nSome industry experts believe the term artificial intelligence is too closely linked to popular culture, and this has caused the general public to have improbable expectations about how AI will change the workplace and life in general. Some researchers and marketers hope the label augmented intelligence, which has a more neutral connotation, will help people understand that most implementations of AI will be weak and simply improve products and services.\\nThe concept of the technological singularity -- a future ruled by an artificial superintelligence that far surpasses the human brain\\'s ability to understand it or how it is shaping our reality --\\xc2\\xa0 remains within the realm of science fiction.\\n\\n\\nEthical use of artificial intelligence\\nWhile AI tools present a range of new functionality for businesses, the use of artificial intelligence also raises ethical questions because, for better or worse, an AI system will reinforce what it has already learned.\\nThis can be problematic because machine learning algorithms, which underpin many of the most advanced AI tools, are only as smart as the data they are given in training. Because a human being selects what data is used to train an AI program, the potential for machine learning bias is inherent and must be monitored closely.\\nAnyone looking to use machine learning as part of real-world, in-production systems needs to factor ethics into their AI training processes and strive to avoid bias. This is especially true when using AI algorithms that are inherently unexplainable in deep learning and generative adversarial network (GAN) applications.\\nExplainability is a potential stumbling block to using AI in industries that operate under strict regulatory compliance requirements. For example, financial institutions in the United States operate under regulations that require them to explain their credit-issuing decisions. When a decision to refuse credit is made by AI programming, however, it can be difficult to explain how the decision was arrived at because the AI tools used to make such decisions operate by teasing out subtle correlations between thousands of variables. When the decision-making process cannot be explained, the program may be referred to as black box AI.\\n\\n\\nComponents of AI\\nAs the hype around AI has accelerated, vendors have been scrambling to promote how their products and services use AI. Often what they refer to as AI is simply one component of AI, such as machine learning. AI requires a foundation of specialized hardware and software for writing and training machine learning algorithms. No one programming language is synonymous with AI, but a few, including Python, R and Java, are popular.\\n\\n\\n\\nAI is not just one technology.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAI as a service (AIaaS)\\nBecause hardware, software and staffing costs for AI can be expensive, many vendors are including AI components in their standard offerings or providing access to artificial intelligence as a service (AIaaS) platforms. AIaaS allows individuals and companies to experiment with AI for various business purposes and sample multiple platforms before making a commitment.\\nPopular AI cloud offerings include the following:\\n\\nAmazon AI\\nIBM Watson Assistant\\nMicrosoft Cognitive Services\\nGoogle AI\\n\\n\\n\\nFour types of artificial intelligence\\nArend Hintze, an assistant professor of integrative biology and computer science and engineering at Michigan State University, explained in a 2016 article that AI can be categorized into four types, beginning with the task-specific intelligent systems in wide use today and progressing to sentient systems, which do not yet exist. The categories are as follows:\\n\\nType 1: Reactive machines. These AI systems have no memory and are task specific. An example is Deep Blue, the IBM chess program that beat Garry Kasparov in the 1990s. Deep Blue can identify pieces on the chessboard and make predictions, but because it has no memory, it cannot use past experiences to inform future ones.\\nType 2: Limited memory. These AI systems have memory, so they can use past experiences to inform future decisions. Some of the decision-making functions in self-driving cars are designed this way.\\nType 3: Theory of mind. Theory of mind is a psychology term. When applied to AI, it means that the system would have the social intelligence to understand emotions. This type of AI will be able to infer human intentions and predict behavior, a necessary skill for AI systems to become integral members of human teams.\\nType 4: Self-awareness. In this category, AI systems have a sense of self, which gives them consciousness. Machines with self-awareness understand their own current state. This type of AI does not yet exist.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCognitive computing and AI\\nThe terms AI and cognitive computing are sometimes used interchangeably, but, generally speaking, the label AI is used in reference to machines that replace human intelligence by simulating how we sense, learn, process and react to information in the environment.\\nThe label cognitive computing is used in reference to products and services that mimic and augment human thought processes\\n\\n\\nExamples of AI technology\\nAI is incorporated into a variety of different types of technology. Here are six examples:\\n\\nAutomation. When paired with AI technologies, automation tools can expand the volume and types of tasks performed. An example is robotic process automation (RPA), a type of software that automates repetitive, rules-based data processing tasks traditionally done by humans. When combined with machine learning and emerging AI tools, RPA can automate bigger portions of enterprise jobs, enabling RPA\\'s tactical bots to pass along intelligence from AI and respond to process changes.\\nMachine learning. This is the science of getting a computer to act without programming. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that, in very simple terms, can be thought of as the automation of predictive analytics. There are three types of machine learning algorithms:\\n\\n\\n\\nSupervised learning. Data sets are labeled so that patterns can be detected and used to label new data sets.\\nUnsupervised learning. Data sets aren\\'t labeled and are sorted according to similarities or differences.\\nReinforcement learning. Data sets aren\\'t labeled but, after performing an action or several actions, the AI system is given feedback.\\n\\n\\n\\nMachine vision. This technology gives a machine the ability to see. Machine vision captures and analyzes visual information using a camera, analog-to-digital conversion and digital signal processing. It is often compared to human eyesight, but machine vision isn\\'t bound by biology and can be programmed to see through walls, for example. It is used in a range of applications from signature identification to medical image analysis. Computer vision, which is focused on machine-based image processing, is often conflated with machine vision.\\nNatural language processing. This is the processing of human language by a computer program. One of the older and \\xc2\\xa0best-known examples of NLP is spam detection, which looks at the subject line and text of an email and decides if it\\'s junk. Current approaches to NLP are based on machine learning. NLP tasks include text translation, sentiment analysis and speech recognition.\\nRobotics. This field of engineering focuses on the design and manufacturing of robots. Robots are often used to perform tasks that are difficult for humans to perform or perform consistently. For example, robots are used in assembly lines for car production or by NASA to move large objects in space. Researchers are also using machine learning to build robots that can interact in social settings.\\nSelf-driving cars. Autonomous vehicles use a combination of computer vision, image recognition and deep learning to build automated skill at piloting a vehicle while staying in a given lane and avoiding unexpected obstructions, such as pedestrians.\\n\\n\\n\\nHistory of AI\\nThe concept of inanimate objects endowed with intelligence has been around since ancient times. The Greek god Hephaestus was depicted in myths as forging robot-like servants out of gold. Engineers in ancient Egypt built statues of gods animated by priests. Throughout the centuries, thinkers from Aristotle to the 13th century Spanish theologian Ramon Llull to Ren\\xc3\\xa9 Descartes and Thomas Bayes used the tools and logic of their times to describe human thought processes as symbols, laying the foundation for AI concepts such as general knowledge representation.\\nThe late 19th and first half of the 20th centuries brought forth the foundational work that would give rise to the modern computer. In 1836, Cambridge University mathematician Charles Babbage and Augusta Ada Byron, Countess of Lovelace, invented the first design for a programmable machine. In the 1940s, Princeton mathematician John Von Neumann conceived the architecture for the stored-program computer -- the idea that a computer\\'s program and the data it processes can be kept in the computer\\'s memory. And Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts laid the foundation for neural networks.\\nWith the advent of modern computers, scientists could test their ideas about machine intelligence. One method for determining whether a computer has intelligence was devised by the British mathematician and World War II code-breaker Alan Turing in 1950. The Turing Test focused on a computer\\'s ability to fool interrogators into believing its responses to their questions were made by a human being.\\nThe modern field of artificial intelligence is widely cited as starting in 1956 during a summer conference at Dartmouth College. Sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the conference was attended by 10 luminaries in the field, including AI pioneers Marvin Minsky, Oliver Selfridge and John McCarthy, who is credited with coining the term artificial intelligence. Also in attendance were Allen Newell, a computer scientist, and Herbert A. Simon, an economist, political scientist and cognitive psychologist, who presented their groundbreaking Logic Theorist, a computer program capable of proving certain mathematical theorems and referred to as the first AI program.\\nIn the wake of the Dartmouth College conference, leaders in the fledgling field of AI predicted that a man-made intelligence equivalent to the human brain was around the corner, attracting major government and industry support. Indeed, nearly 20 years of well-funded basic research generated significant advances in AI: For example, in the late 1950s, Newell and Simon published the General Problem Solver (GPS) algorithm, which fell short of solving complex problems but laid the foundations for developing more sophisticated cognitive architectures; McCarthy developed Lisp, a language for AI programming that is still used today. In the mid-1960s MIT Professor Joseph Weizenbaum developed ELIZA, an early natural language processing program that laid the foundation for today\\'s chatbots.\\nBut the achievement of artificial general intelligence proved elusive, not imminent, hampered by limitations in computer processing and memory and by the complexity of the problem. Government and corporations backed away from their support of AI research, leading to a fallow period lasting from 1974 to 1980 and known as the first \"AI Winter.\" In the 1980s, research on deep learning techniques and industry\\'s adoption of Edward Feigenbaum\\'s expert systems sparked a new wave of AI enthusiasm, only to be followed by another collapse of government funding and industry support. The second AI winter lasted until the mid-1990s.\\n\\n\\n\\nSupport for the modern field of AI, 1956 to the present.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncreases in computational power and an explosion of data sparked an AI renaissance in the late 1990s that has continued to present times. The latest focus on AI has given rise to breakthroughs in natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, machine learning, deep learning and more. Moreover, AI is becoming ever more tangible, powering cars, diagnosing disease and cementing its role in popular culture. In 1997, IBM\\'s Deep Blue defeated Russian chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov, becoming the first computer program to beat a world chess champion. Fourteen years later, IBM\\'s Watson captivated the public when it defeated two former champions on the game show Jeopardy!. More recently, the historic defeat of 18-time World Go champion Lee Sedol by Google DeepMind\\'s AlphaGo stunned the Go community and marked a major milestone in the development of intelligent machines.\\n\\n\\nApplications of AI\\nArtificial intelligence has made its way into a wide variety of markets. Here are eight examples.\\n\\nAI in healthcare. The biggest bets are on improving patient outcomes and reducing costs. Companies are applying machine learning to make better and faster diagnoses than humans. One of the best-known healthcare technologies is IBM Watson. It understands natural language and can respond to questions asked of it. The system mines patient data and other available data sources to form a hypothesis, which it then presents with a confidence scoring schema. Other AI applications include using online virtual health assistants and chatbots to help patients and healthcare customers find medical information, schedule appointments, understand the billing process and complete other administrative processes. An array of AI technologies is also being used to predict, fight and understand pandemics such as COVID-19.\\nAI in business. Machine learning algorithms are being integrated into analytics and customer relationship management (CRM) platforms to uncover information on how to better serve customers. Chatbots have been incorporated into websites to provide immediate service to customers. Automation of job positions has also become a talking point among academics and IT analysts.\\nAI in education. AI can automate grading, giving educators more time. It can assess students and adapt to their needs, helping them work at their own pace. AI tutors can provide additional support to students, ensuring they stay on track. And it could change where and how students learn, perhaps even replacing some teachers.\\nAI in finance. AI in personal finance applications, such as Intuit Mint or TurboTax, is disrupting financial institutions. Applications such as these collect personal data and provide financial advice. Other programs, such as IBM Watson, have been applied to the process of buying a home. Today, artificial intelligence software performs much of the trading on Wall Street.\\nAI in law. The discovery process -- sifting through documents -- in law is often overwhelming for humans. Using AI to help automate the legal industry\\'s labor-intensive processes is saving time and improving client service. Law firms are using machine learning to describe data and predict outcomes, computer vision to classify and extract information from documents and natural language processing to interpret requests for information.\\nAI in manufacturing. Manufacturing has been at the forefront of incorporating robots into the workflow. For example, the industrial robots that were at one time programmed to perform single tasks and separated from human workers, increasingly function as cobots: Smaller, multitasking robots that collaborate with humans and take on responsibility for more parts of the job in warehouses, factory floors and other workspaces.\\nAI in banking. Banks are successfully employing chatbots to make their customers aware of services and offerings and to handle transactions that don\\'t require human intervention. AI virtual assistants are being used to improve and cut the costs of compliance with banking regulations. Banking organizations are also using AI to improve their decision-making for loans, and to set credit limits and identify investment opportunities.\\nAI in transportation. In addition to AI\\'s fundamental role in operating autonomous vehicles, AI technologies are used in transportation to manage traffic, predict flight delays, and make ocean shipping safer and more efficient.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAI in security\\nAI and machine learning are at the top of the buzzword list security vendors use today to differentiate their offerings. Those terms also represent truly viable technologies. Artificial intelligence and machine learning in cybersecurity products are adding real value for security teams looking for ways to identify attacks, malware and other threats.\\nOrganizations use machine learning in security information and event management (SIEM) software and related areas to detect anomalies and identify suspicious activities that indicate threats. By analyzing data and using logic to identify similarities to known malicious code, AI can provide alerts to new and emerging attacks much sooner than human employees and previous technology iterations.\\nAs a result, AI security technology both dramatically lowers the number of false positives and gives organizations more time to counteract real threats before damage is done. The maturing technology is playing a big role in helping organizations fight off cyberattacks.\\n\\n\\nRegulation of AI technology\\nDespite potential risks, there are currently few regulations governing the use of AI tools, and where laws do exist, they typically pertain to AI indirectly. For example, as previously mentioned, United States Fair Lending regulations require financial institutions to explain credit decisions to potential customers. This limits the extent to which lenders can use deep learning algorithms, which by their nature are opaque and lack explainability.\\nThe Europe Union\\'s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) puts strict limits on how enterprises can use consumer data, which impedes the training and functionality of many consumer-facing AI applications.\\nIn October 2016, the National Science and Technology Council issued a report examining the potential role governmental regulation might play in AI development, but it did not recommend specific legislation be considered.\\nCrafting laws to regulate AI will not be easy, in part because AI comprises a variety of technologies that companies use for different ends, and partly because regulations can come at the cost of AI progress and development. The rapid evolution of AI technologies is another obstacle to forming meaningful regulation of AI. Technology breakthroughs and novel applications can make existing laws instantly obsolete. For example, existing laws regulating the privacy of conversations and recorded conversations do not cover the challenge posed by voice assistants like Amazon\\'s Alexa and Apple\\'s Siri that gather but do not distribute conversation -- except to the companies\\' technology teams which use it to improve machine learning algorithms. And, of course, the laws that governments do manage to craft to regulate AI don\\'t stop criminals from using the technology with malicious intent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThis was last updated in May 2020\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tContinue Reading About artificial intelligence\\r\\n\\t\\t\\n\\nAutomated journalism creeps into newsrooms leaning on AI\\n\\n\\nAlgorithmic bias top problem enterprises must tackle\\n\\n\\nAI process automation offers benefits, but challenges remain\\n\\n\\nAI in IT infrastructure transforms how work gets done\\n\\n\\nArtificial intelligence is now a Pentagon priority.

Some people say this impact is positive, but others think\\nthat the benefits it brings may cause addiction.\\n\\nIn my opinion, people can use this advantage for the good of humanity and make their\\nlife easier than before. For example, when the first robots appeared some of\\nthe most difficult tasks could be solved efficiently and in short time. It is\\nalso interesting that some humanoid robots can interact with humans, making\\ngestures or moving their heads.\\n\\nI like many of the uses where this new kind of intelligence can be applied. In the health\\narea there are machines that can diagnose human illnesses and in the education\\narea students can access additional help through computerized assistants. Machines\\ncan provide support when someone needs it.\\n\\nThe benefits that AI can bring to society will hopefully make the world better, but\\nhumanity must take control to assure the correct operation of the machines. I\\nsay this because I have read about machines getting smarter than people and developing\\ntheir own conscience in levels that might harm human welfare. It is necessary\\nto clearly establish limits to avoid misuse of the machine\\xc2\\xb4s learning capacity that\\nthis new type of intelligence is reaching today.\\n\\n\\n\\nAdd My Comment\\nCancel\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xc2\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[-]\\n\\n\\n\\nanuragrai\\n - 12 Jun 2019 11:21 PM\\n\\nThank You To sharing This , Very Help Full Post About Artificial Intelligence\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nAdd My Comment\\nCancel\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xc2\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[-]\\n\\n\\n\\n696969696969\\n - 18 Jun 2019 7:23 PM\\n\\nhehe\\n\\n\\n\\nAdd My Comment\\nCancel\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xc2\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[-]\\n\\n\\n\\n696969696969\\n - 18 Jun 2019 7:43 PM\\n\\nhonestly the AI is messing up my life i mean like it aint working right. any ideas on how to fix ladies?-sincerely barbara\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nAdd My Comment\\nCancel\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xc2\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[-]\\n\\n\\n\\nsafeharbourship\\n - 1 Jul 2019 4:08 AM\\n\\nIT is an engrossing article .I am very fascinated by your\\npost .Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence\\nprocesses by machines, especially computer systems.\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nAdd My Comment\\nCancel\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xc2\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[-]\\n\\n\\n\\nDarkDevil\\n - 23 Jul 2019 1:37 AM\\n\\nThats the best notes for forever abou artificial intelligence .\\n\\n\\n\\nAdd My Comment\\nCancel\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xc2\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[-]\\n\\n\\n\\nRalphTDolphins\\n - 8 Aug 2019 12:50 PM\\n\\nBecause they cant get tired, machines can do a lot of work and multi tasked work when artificial intelligence is applied, I think maybe in 2050 or 2090, machines would do almost all the jobs done by humans. People would sit at home and control these machines, imagine a company made up of machines (robots), everybody would focus on their work, they can work 24 hours a day, 168 hours a week without getting tired and maybe 8064 hours a year.

While science fiction often portrays AI as robots with human-like characteristics, AI can encompass anything from Google\\xe2\\x80\\x99s search algorithms to IBM\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Watson to autonomous weapons.\\nArtificial intelligence today is properly known as narrow AI (or weak AI), in that it is designed to perform a narrow task (e.g. only facial recognition or only internet searches or only driving a car). However, the long-term goal of many\\xc2\\xa0researchers is to create\\xc2\\xa0general AI (AGI or strong AI). While narrow AI may outperform humans at\\xc2\\xa0whatever its specific task is, like playing chess or solving equations, AGI would outperform\\xc2\\xa0humans at\\xc2\\xa0nearly every cognitive task.\\n\\nWhy research AI safety?\\nIn the near term, the goal of keeping\\xc2\\xa0AI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s impact on society beneficial motivates research in many areas, from economics and law to technical topics such as\\xc2\\xa0verification,\\xc2\\xa0validity,\\xc2\\xa0security and\\xc2\\xa0control. Whereas it may be little more than a minor nuisance if\\xc2\\xa0your laptop crashes or gets hacked, it becomes all the more important that an AI system does what you\\xc2\\xa0want it to do if it controls your car, your airplane, your pacemaker, your automated trading system or your power grid. Another short-term challenge is\\xc2\\xa0preventing\\xc2\\xa0a devastating arms race in lethal autonomous weapons.\\nIn the long term, an important question is what will happen if the quest for strong AI succeeds and an AI system becomes better than humans at all cognitive tasks. As pointed out by I.J. Good in 1965, designing smarter AI systems is itself a cognitive task. Such a system could potentially undergo recursive self-improvement, triggering an intelligence explosion leaving human intellect\\xc2\\xa0far behind. By inventing revolutionary new technologies, such\\xc2\\xa0a superintelligence might\\xc2\\xa0help us\\xc2\\xa0eradicate war, disease, and poverty, and so the creation of\\xc2\\xa0strong AI might\\xc2\\xa0be the biggest event in human history.\\xc2\\xa0Some experts have expressed concern, though, that it might also be the last, unless we learn to align the goals of the AI\\xc2\\xa0with ours before it becomes superintelligent.\\nThere are some who question whether strong\\xc2\\xa0AI will ever be achieved, and others who insist that the creation of superintelligent AI is guaranteed\\xc2\\xa0to be beneficial. At FLI we recognize both of these possibilities, but\\xc2\\xa0also recognize the potential for an artificial intelligence system to\\xc2\\xa0intentionally or unintentionally cause great harm. We believe research today will help us better prepare for and prevent such potentially negative\\xc2\\xa0consequences in the future, thus enjoying the benefits of AI while avoiding pitfalls.\\n\\nHow can AI be dangerous?\\nMost researchers agree that a superintelligent AI is unlikely to exhibit human emotions like love or hate, and that there is no reason to expect AI to become intentionally benevolent or malevolent.\\xc2\\xa0Instead, when considering how AI might\\xc2\\xa0become a risk, experts think two scenarios most likely:\\n\\nThe AI is programmed to do something devastating:\\xc2\\xa0Autonomous weapons are artificial intelligence systems that are programmed to kill. In the hands of the wrong person, these weapons could easily cause mass casualties. Moreover,\\xc2\\xa0an AI arms race could inadvertently lead to an AI war that also results in mass casualties. To avoid being thwarted by the enemy, these weapons would be\\xc2\\xa0designed\\xc2\\xa0to be extremely difficult to simply\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x9cturn off,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d so humans could plausibly\\xc2\\xa0lose control of such a situation. This risk is one that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s present even with narrow AI, but grows as levels of AI intelligence and autonomy increase.\\nThe AI is programmed to do something beneficial, but it develops a destructive method for achieving its goal:\\xc2\\xa0This can happen whenever we fail to fully align the AI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s goals with ours, which is strikingly difficult. If you ask an obedient intelligent car to take you to the airport as fast as possible, it might\\xc2\\xa0get you there chased by helicopters and covered in vomit, doing\\xc2\\xa0not what you wanted but literally what you asked for. If a superintelligent system is tasked with a ambitious geoengineering project, it might\\xc2\\xa0wreak havoc with our\\xc2\\xa0ecosystem as a side effect, and view human attempts to stop it as a threat to be met.\\n\\nAs these examples illustrate, the concern about advanced AI isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t malevolence but competence.\\xc2\\xa0A super-intelligent AI will be extremely good at accomplishing its goals, and if those goals aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t aligned with ours, we\\xc2\\xa0have a problem. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re probably not an evil ant-hater who steps on ants out of malice, but if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in charge of a hydroelectric green energy project and there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an anthill in the region to be flooded, too bad for the ants. A key goal of AI safety research is to never place humanity in the position of those ants.\\n\\nWhy the recent interest in AI safety\\nStephen Hawking, Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak, Bill Gates, and many other big names in science and technology have recently expressed concern in the media and via open letters about the risks posed by AI, joined by many leading AI researchers. Why is the subject suddenly in the headlines? \\nThe idea that the quest for strong AI would ultimately succeed was long thought of as science fiction, centuries or more away. However, thanks to recent breakthroughs, many AI milestones, which experts viewed as decades away merely five years ago, have now been reached, making many experts take seriously the possibility of superintelligence in our lifetime.\\xc2\\xa0While some experts still guess that human-level AI is centuries away, most AI researches at the 2015 Puerto Rico Conference guessed that it would happen before 2060. Since it may take decades to complete the required safety research, it is prudent to start it now.\\nBecause AI has the potential to become more intelligent than any human, we have no surefire way of predicting how it will behave. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use past technological developments as much of a basis because we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never created anything that has the ability to, wittingly or unwittingly, outsmart us. The best example of what we could face may be our own evolution. People now control the planet, not because we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re the strongest, fastest or biggest, but because we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re the smartest. If we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re no longer the smartest, are we assured to remain in control?\\nFLI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s position is that our civilization will flourish as long as we win the race between the growing power of technology and the wisdom with which we manage it. In the case of AI technology, FLI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s position is that the best way to win that race is not to impede the former, but to accelerate the latter, by supporting AI safety research.\\n\\nThe Top Myths About Advanced AI\\nA captivating\\xc2\\xa0conversation is taking place about the future of artificial intelligence and what it will/should mean for humanity.\\xc2\\xa0There are fascinating controversies where\\xc2\\xa0the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leading experts disagree, such as: AI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s future impact on the job market; if/when human-level AI will be developed; whether this will lead to an intelligence explosion; and whether this is\\xc2\\xa0something we should welcome\\xc2\\xa0or fear.\\xc2\\xa0But there are\\xc2\\xa0also many examples of of boring pseudo-controversies caused by people misunderstanding and talking past each other.\\xc2\\xa0To help ourselves focus on the interesting controversies and open questions \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and not on the misunderstandings \\xe2\\x80\\x94 let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xc2\\xa0clear up some of the most common myths.\\n\\n\\nTimeline Myths\\nThe first myth regards the timeline: how long will it take until machines greatly supersede human-level intelligence? A common misconception is that we know the answer with great certainty.\\nOne popular myth is that we know we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get superhuman AI this century.\\xc2\\xa0In fact, history is full of technological over-hyping. Where are those fusion power plants and flying cars we were promised we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have by now?\\xc2\\xa0AI has also been repeatedly over-hyped in the past, even by some of the founders of the field. For example, John McCarthy (who coined the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cartificial intelligence\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester and Claude Shannon\\xc2\\xa0wrote this overly optimistic forecast about what could be accomplished during two months with stone-age computers:\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe propose that a 2 month, 10 man study of artificial intelligence be carried out during the summer of 1956 at Dartmouth College [\\xe2\\x80\\xa6]\\xc2\\xa0An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves. We think that a significant advance can be made in one or more of these problems if a carefully selected group of scientists work on it together for a summer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nOn the other hand, a popular counter-myth is that we know we won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get superhuman AI this century.\\xc2\\xa0Researchers have made a wide range of estimates for how far we are from superhuman AI, but we certainly can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say with great confidence that the probability is zero this century, given the dismal track record of such techno-skeptic predictions. For example, Ernest Rutherford, arguably the greatest nuclear physicist of his time, said in 1933 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 less than 24 hours before Szilard\\xe2\\x80\\x99s invention of the nuclear chain reaction \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that nuclear energy was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmoonshine.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And\\xc2\\xa0Astronomer Royal Richard Woolley called interplanetary travel \\xe2\\x80\\x9cutter bilge\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in 1956.\\xc2\\xa0The most extreme form of this myth is that superhuman AI will never arrive because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s physically impossible.\\xc2\\xa0However, physicists know that a brain consists of quarks and electrons arranged to act as a powerful computer, and that there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no law of physics preventing us from building even more intelligent quark blobs.\\nThere have been a number of surveys asking AI researchers how many years from now they think\\xc2\\xa0we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have human-level AI with at least 50% probability. All these surveys have the same conclusion: the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leading experts disagree, so we simply don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know.\\xc2\\xa0For example, in such a poll of the AI researchers at the 2015 Puerto Rico AI conference, the average (median) answer was by year 2045, but some researchers guessed hundreds of years or more.\\nThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also a related myth that people who worry about AI think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only a few years away. In fact, most people on record worrying about superhuman AI guess it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still at least decades away. But they argue that as long as we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not 100% sure that it won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happen this century, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s smart to start safety research now to prepare for the eventuality. Many of the safety problems associated with human-level AI are so hard that they may take decades to solve. So it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prudent to start researching them now rather than the night before some programmers drinking Red Bull decide to switch one\\xc2\\xa0on.\\n\\nControversy Myths\\nAnother common misconception is that the only people harboring concerns about AI and advocating AI safety research are luddites who don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know much about AI. When Stuart Russell, author of the standard AI textbook, mentioned this during his Puerto Rico talk, the audience laughed loudly. A related misconception is that supporting AI safety research is hugely controversial. In fact, to support a modest investment in AI safety research, people don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to be convinced that risks are high, merely non-negligible \\xe2\\x80\\x94 just as a modest investment in home insurance is justified by a non-negligible probability of the home burning down.\\nIt may be that\\xc2\\xa0media have made the AI safety debate seem more controversial than it really is.\\xc2\\xa0After all, fear sells, and articles using out-of-context quotes to proclaim imminent doom can generate more clicks than nuanced and balanced ones.\\xc2\\xa0As a result, two people who only know about each other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s positions from media quotes are likely to think they disagree more than they really do. For example, a techno-skeptic who only read about Bill Gates\\xe2\\x80\\x99s position in a British tabloid may mistakenly think Gates believes superintelligence to be imminent. Similarly, someone in the beneficial-AI movement who knows nothing about Andrew Ng\\xe2\\x80\\x99s position except his quote about overpopulation on Mars may mistakenly think he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care about AI safety, whereas in fact, he does. The crux is simply that because Ng\\xe2\\x80\\x99s timeline estimates are longer, he naturally tends to prioritize short-term AI challenges over long-term ones.\\n\\nMyths About the Risks of Superhuman AI\\nMany AI researchers roll their eyes when seeing this headline:\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x9cStephen Hawking warns that rise of robots may be disastrous for mankind.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And as many have\\xc2\\xa0lost count of how many similar articles they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve\\xc2\\xa0seen.\\xc2\\xa0Typically, these articles are accompanied by an evil-looking robot carrying a weapon, and they suggest we should worry about robots rising up and killing us because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve become conscious and/or evil.\\xc2\\xa0On a lighter note, such articles are actually rather impressive, because they succinctly summarize the scenario that AI researchers don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\xc2\\xa0worry about. That scenario combines as many as three separate misconceptions: concern about consciousness, evil, and\\xc2\\xa0robots.\\nIf you drive down the road, you have a subjective experience of colors, sounds, etc. But does a self-driving car have a subjective experience? Does it feel like anything at all to be a self-driving car?\\xc2\\xa0Although this mystery of consciousness is interesting in its own right, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s irrelevant to AI risk. If you get struck by a driverless car, it makes no difference to you whether it subjectively feels conscious. In the same way, what will affect us humans is what superintelligent AI\\xc2\\xa0does, not how it subjectively feels.\\nThe fear of machines turning evil is another red herring. The real worry isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t malevolence, but competence. A superintelligent AI is by definition very good at attaining its goals, whatever they may be, so we need to ensure that its goals are aligned with ours. Humans don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t generally hate ants, but we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re more intelligent than they are \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so if we want to build a hydroelectric dam and there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an anthill there, too bad for the ants. The beneficial-AI movement wants to avoid placing humanity in the position of those ants.\\nThe consciousness misconception is related to the myth that machines can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have goals.\\xc2\\xa0Machines can obviously have goals in the narrow sense of exhibiting goal-oriented behavior: the behavior of a heat-seeking missile is most economically explained as a goal to hit a target.\\xc2\\xa0If you feel threatened by a machine whose goals are misaligned with yours, then it is precisely its goals in this narrow sense that troubles you, not whether the machine is conscious and experiences a sense of purpose.\\xc2\\xa0If that heat-seeking missile were chasing you, you probably wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exclaim: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not worried, because machines can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have goals!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nI sympathize with Rodney Brooks and other robotics pioneers who feel unfairly demonized by scaremongering tabloids,\\xc2\\xa0because some journalists seem obsessively fixated on robots and adorn many of their articles with evil-looking metal monsters with red shiny eyes. In fact, the main concern of the beneficial-AI movement isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t with robots but with intelligence itself: specifically, intelligence whose goals are misaligned with ours. To cause us trouble, such misaligned superhuman intelligence needs no robotic body, merely an internet connection \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this may enable outsmarting financial markets, out-inventing human researchers, out-manipulating human leaders, and developing weapons we cannot even understand. Even if building robots were physically impossible, a super-intelligent and super-wealthy AI could easily pay or manipulate many humans to unwittingly do its bidding.\\nThe robot misconception is related to the myth that machines can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t control humans. Intelligence enables control: humans control tigers not because we are stronger, but because we are smarter. This means that if we cede our position as smartest on our planet, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s possible that we might also cede control.\\n\\nThe Interesting Controversies\\nNot\\xc2\\xa0wasting time on the above-mentioned misconceptions\\xc2\\xa0lets us\\xc2\\xa0focus on true and interesting controversies where even the experts disagree. What sort of future do you want?\\xc2\\xa0Should we develop lethal autonomous weapons?\\xc2\\xa0What would you like to happen with job automation?\\xc2\\xa0What career advice would you give today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s kids?\\xc2\\xa0Do you prefer new jobs replacing the old ones, or a jobless society where everyone enjoys a life of leisure and machine-produced wealth?\\xc2\\xa0Further down the road, would you like us to create superintelligent life and spread it through our cosmos?\\xc2\\xa0Will we control intelligent machines or will they control us?\\xc2\\xa0Will intelligent machines replace us, coexist with us, or merge with us?\\xc2\\xa0What will it mean to be human in the age of artificial intelligence? What would you like it to mean, and how can we make the future be that way?

Our cognitive apparatus has evolved as a \\xe2\\x80\\x98servant\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of that \\xe2\\x80\\x98Will\\xe2\\x80\\x99. Any attempt to interpret human behaviour as primarily a system of computing mechanisms and our brain as a sort of computing apparatus is therefore doomed to failure.

It becomes dangerous only if humans, for example, engage in foolish biological engineering experiments to combine an evolved biological entity with an AI.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRastko Vukovic says:\\n\\n\\n\\nJune 6, 2016 at 5:48 am \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence is not a robot that follows the programmer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s code, but the life.

That kind of systems could be designed with predetermined goals and operational space, which could be chosen so that every goals from that set could be reached in the chosen prematurely operational space.\\nThat approach to design of the artificial systems is subject of second-order cybernetics, but I am already know how to chose these goals and operational space to satisfy these requirements.\\nThe danger exist because that kind of the artificial systems will not perceive humans as members of their society, and human moral rules will be null for them.\\nThat danger could be avoided if such systems will be designed so that they are will not have their own egoistic interests.\\nThat is real solution to the safety problem of so called AI systems.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nSumathy Ramesh says:\\n\\n\\n\\nAugust 4, 2016 at 10:49 pm \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUnderstanding how the brain works is arguably one of the greatest scientific challenges of our time.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93Alivisatos et al.[1]\\nLets keep it that way lest systems built to protect human rights on millenniums of wisdom is brought down by some artificial intelligence engineer trying to clock a milestone on their gantt chart!!!!\\nI read about Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s support for the brain research initiatives several months ago with some interest. It even mildly sounded good; there are checks and balances ingrained in the systems of public funding for research, right from the application for funding, through grant approval, scope validation and ethics approval to the conduct of the research; there are systematic reviews of the methods and findings to spot weaknesses that would compromise the safety of the principles and the people involved; there are processes to evolve the checks and balances to ensure the continued safety of such principles and the people. The strength of the FDA, the MDD, the TGA and their likes in the developing nations is a testament to how the rigor of the conduct of the research and the regulations grow together so another initiative such as the development of atomic bomb are nibbled before they so much as think of budding!!!\\xe2\\x80\\xa8\\xe2\\x80\\xa8\\nAnd then I read about the enormous engagement of the global software industry in the areas of Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience. Theses are technological giants who sell directly to the consumers infatuated with technology more than anything else. they are pouring their efforts into artificial intelligence research for reasons as many as the number of individual engineering teams that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s charged to cross 1 mm of their mile long project plan! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be surprised if if any one of them has the bandwidth to think beyond the 1 mm that they have to cross, let alone the consequences of their collective effort on human rights!\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa8\\xe2\\x80\\xa8I am worried.\\nGiven the pace of the industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s engagement, I believe there is an immediate need for Bio-signal interface technical standards to be developed and established. These standards would serve as instruments to preserve the simple fact upon which every justice system in the world has been built viz., the brain and nervous system of an individual belongs to an individual and is not to be accessed by other individuals or machines with out stated consent for stated purposes.\\nThe standards will identify the frequency bands or pulse trains for exclusion in all research tools- software or otherwise, commercially available products, regulated devices, tools of trade, and communication infrastructure such that inadvertent breech of barriers to an individual\\xe2\\x80\\x99s brain and nervous system is prohibited. The standards will form a basis for international telecommunication infrastructure (including satellites and cell phone towers) to enforce compliance by electronically blocking and monitoring offending signals.\\nTypically such standards are developed by international organizations with direct or indirect representation from industry stakeholders and adopted by the regulators of various countries over a period of one or more years. Subsequently they are adopted by the industry. The risk of noncompliance is managed on a case by case basis \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the timing determinant on the extent of impact. Unfortunately this model will not be adequate for cutting edge technology with the ability to cause irreversible damage to the very fabric of the human society, if the technology becomes commonplace before the development of the necessary checks and balances. Development of tools to study the brain using electromagnetic energy based technology based on state of the art commercial telecommunication infrastructure is one such example. What we need is leadership to engage the regulators, academics as well as prominent players in the industry in the development of standards and sustainable solutions to enforce compliance and monitoring.\\nThe ray of hope I see at this stage is that artificial Wisdom is still a few years away because human wisdom is not coded in the layer of the neutron that the technology has the capacity to map.\\xe2\\x80\\xa8\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nJeff Hershkowitz says:\\n\\n\\n\\nAugust 5, 2016 at 10:48 am \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow does society cope with an AI-driven reality where people are no longer needed or used in the work place?\\nWhat happens to our socio-economic structure when people have little or no value in the work place?\\nWhat will people do for value or contribution in order to receive income, in an exponentially growing population with inversely proportional fewer jobs and available resources?\\nFrom my simple-minded perspective and connecting the dots to what seems a logical conclusion, we will soon live in a world bursting at the seams with overpopulation, where an individual has no marketable skill and is a social and economic liability to the few who own either technology or hard assets. This in turn will lead to a giant lower class, no middle class and a few elites who own the planet (not unlike the direction we are already headed).\\nIn such a society there will likely be little if any rights for the individual, and population control by whatever means will be the rule of the day.\\nSeems like a doomsday or dark-age scenario to me..\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nGabor Farkas says:\\n\\n\\n\\nSeptember 30, 2016 at 12:06 pm \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy do we assume that AI will require more and more physical space and more power when human intelligence continuously manages to miniaturize and reduce power consumption of its devices.

An\\xc2\\xa0asset\\xc2\\xa0can be tangible (a house, a car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding). Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.\\nThe need for blockchain\\nYou can gain a deeper understanding of blockchain by exploring the context in which it was developed: the need for an efficient, cost-effective, reliable, and secure system for conducting and recording financial transactions.\\nThe shortcomings of current transaction systems\\nThroughout history, instruments of trust, such as minted coins, paper money, letters of credit, and banking systems, have emerged to facilitate the exchange of value and protect buyers and sellers. Important innovations (for example, telephone lines, credit card systems, the Internet, and mobile technologies) have improved the convenience, speed, and efficiency of transactions while shrinking \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and sometimes virtually eliminating \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the distance between buyers and sellers.\\xc2\\xa0\\nIn spite of this, many business transactions remain inefficient, expensive, and vulnerable, suffering from the following limitations:\\nCash is useful only in\\xc2\\xa0local transactions and in relatively small amounts.\\nThe time between transaction and settlement can be long.\\nDuplication of effort and the need for third-party validation and/or the presence of intermediaries add to inefficiencies.\\nFraud, cyberattacks, and even simple mistakes add to the cost and complexity of doing business, exposing all participants in the network to risk if a central system\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x94 such as a bank\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x94 is compromised.\\nCredit card organizations are walled gardens with a high price of entry. Merchants must pay the high costs of onboarding, which often involves considerable paperwork and a time-consuming vetting process.\\nHalf of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s people don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have access to bank accounts, requiring them to develop parallel payment systems to conduct transactions.\\nLimited transparency and inconsistent information hinder the efficient movement of goods in the shipping industry.\\nTransaction volumes worldwide are growing exponentially and will surely magnify the complexities, vulnerabilities, inefficiencies, and costs of current transaction systems. The growth of ecommerce, online banking, and in-app purchases, coupled with the increasing mobility of people around the world, have fueled the growth of transaction volumes. And transaction volumes have exploded with the rise of Internet of Things (IoT)\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x94 autonomous objects, such as refrigerators that buy groceries when supplies are\\xc2\\xa0running low and cars that deliver themselves to your door, stopping for fuel along the way.\\nTo address these challenges and others, the world needs faster payment networks that provide mechanisms to establish trust, require no specialized equipment, have no chargebacks or monthly fees, and offer a collective bookkeeping solution for ensuring transparency and trust.\\n Download the \"Blockchain for Dummies\" ebook now\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Key elements of a blockchain\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDistributed ledger technology\\nAll network participants have access to the distributed ledger and its immutable record of transactions. With this shared ledger, transactions are recorded only once, eliminating the duplication of effort that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s typical of traditional business networks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRecords are immutable\\nNo participant can change or tamper with a transaction after it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been recorded to the shared ledger. If a transaction record\\xc2\\xa0includes\\xc2\\xa0an error, a new transaction must be added to reverse the error, and both transactions are then visible.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSmart contracts\\nTo speed transactions, a set of rules \\xe2\\x80\\x93 called a smart contract \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is stored on the blockchain and executed automatically. A smart contract can define conditions for corporate bond transfers, include terms for travel insurance to be paid and much more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBlockchain 101 in five minutes\\nUnderstanding the basics of blockchain technology can be challenging.

They can be public, private, permissioned, or built by a consortium. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPublic blockchain networks\\nA public blockchain is one that anyone can join and participate in, such as Bitcoin. Drawbacks might include substantial computational power required, little or no privacy for transactions, and weak security. These are important considerations for enterprise\\xc2\\xa0use cases\\xc2\\xa0of blockchain.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrivate blockchain networks\\nA private blockchain network, similar to a public blockchain network, is a decentralized peer-to-peer network, with the significant difference that one organization governs the network. That organization controls who is allowed to participate in the network, execute a\\xc2\\xa0consensus\\xc2\\xa0protocol and maintain the shared ledger. Depending on the use case, this can significantly boost trust and confidence between participants. A private blockchain can be run behind a corporate firewall and even be hosted on-premises.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPermissioned blockchain networks\\nBusinesses who set up a private blockchain, will generally set up a\\xc2\\xa0permissioned\\xc2\\xa0blockchain network. It is important to note that public blockchain networks can also be a permissioned. This places restrictions on who is allowed to participate in the network, and only in certain transactions. Participants need to obtain an invitation or\\xc2\\xa0permission\\xc2\\xa0to join.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConsortium blockchains\\nMultiple organizations can share the responsibilities of maintaining a blockchain. These pre-selected organizations determine who may submit transactions or access the data. A consortium blockchain is ideal for business when all participants need to be permissioned\\xc2\\xa0and have a shared responsibility for the blockchain.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  See how these industries are using blockchain\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFood: Tracing fresh seafood from the moment it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s caught\\nIBM Food Trust is helping Raw Seafoods increase trust across the food supply chain by tracing every catch right from the water \\xe2\\x80\\x94 all the way to supermarkets and restaurants.\\n \\n\\nWatch: Building trust in food\\n\\n  Learn about IBM Food Trust\\xe2\\x84\\xa2\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFinancial services: Improving cryptocurrency security\\nINBLOCK issues Metacoin cryptocurrency, which is based on Hyperledger fabric, to help make digital asset transactions faster, more convenient and safer.\\n \\n\\nWatch: Cryptocurrency security\\n\\n  IBM Blockchain for Financial services\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHealthcare: Transform outcomes with blockchain \\nThe IBM Blockchain Platform can change the way your ecosystem ensures trust, data provenance and efficiency to improve patient care and profitability.\\n  Transform healthcare outcomes (188\\xc2\\xa0KB)\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSupply chain: Fresh thinking in blockchain, AI and IoT\\nLearn how Golden State Foods is using the immutability of blockchain to trace goods through their supply chain and help ensure food quality.\\n \\n\\nWatch: Managing the supply chain\\n\\n  IBM Blockchain for Supply chain\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Blockchain in your industry\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  IBM Blockchain offerings to help make your network a success\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBuild on a platform designed for today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s multicloud world\\nTechnical innovators turn to the IBM Blockchain Platform, the leading\\xc2\\xa0Hyperledger Fabric\\xc2\\xa0platform, to build, operate, govern and grow blockchain solutions across any computing environment through\\xc2\\xa0Red Hat\\xc2\\xae OpenShift\\xc2\\xae.\\n  Learn about the IBM Blockchain Platform\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBe part of the new era of trust in the food industry\\nIBM Food Trust\\xc2\\xa0helps growers, distributors and retailers build trust and make our food safer, by enhancing visibility and accountability in every step of the food supply.

And in the same way Linux took more than a decade to become a cornerstone in modern application development, Blockchain will likely take years to become a lower cost, more efficient way to share information and data between open and private business networks.Based on a peer-to-peer (P2P) topology, blockchain is a distributed ledger technology (DLT) that allows data to be stored globally on thousands of servers \\xe2\\x80\\x93 while letting anyone on the network see everyone else\\'s entries in near real-time. That makes it difficult for one user to gain control of, or game, the network.[ Further reading: What is FinTech (and how has it evolved)? ]However, in highly publicized incidents over the five years, blockchains have been hacked, typically through a cryptocurrency application such as bitcoin. Smaller blockchains\\xc2\\xa0with fewer nodes (or computers) have also been susceptible to fraud, with would-be thieves gaining control of the majority of nodes.For businesses, however, blockchain holds the promise of transactional transparency \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the ability to create secure, real-time communication networks with partners around the globe to support everything from supply chains to payment networks to real estate deals and healthcare data sharing.Recent hype around this relatively new technology is real because DLT, in essense, represents a new paradigm for how information is shared; tech vendors and enterprises, not surprisingly have rushed to learn how they can use the distributed ledger technology (DLT) to save time and admin costs. Numerous companies have already\\xc2\\xa0rolled out, or are planning to launch, pilot programs and real-world projects\\xc2\\xa0across a variety of industries - everything from financial technology\\xc2\\xa0(FinTech) and healthcare to mobile payments\\xc2\\xa0and\\xc2\\xa0global shipping.So while blockchain isn\\'t going to replace traditional corporate relational databases, it does open new doors for the movement and storage of transactional data inside and outside of global enterprises. Driven mainly by financial technology (fintech) investments, blockchain has seen a fast uptick in adoption for application development and pilot tests in a number of industries and will generate more than $10.6 billion in revenue by 2023, according to a report from ABI Research. Most of that revenue figure is expected to come from software sales and services.\\nBlockchain adoption is expected be steady, as the changes it brings gain momentum, according Karim Lakhani, a principal investigator of the Crowd Innovation Lab and NASA Tournament Lab at the Harvard Institute for Quantitative Social Science. \"Conceptionally, this is TCP/IP applied to the world of business and transactions,\" Lakhani said. \"In the \\'70s and \\'80s, TCP/IP was not imaginable to be as robust and scalable as it was. Now, we know that TCP/IP allows us all this modern functionality that we take for granted on the web. \"Blockchain has the same potential.\"\\xc2\\xa0 Gartner\\n\\nA Gartner survey of CIOs last spring revealed only 1% had blockchain deployed in production environments; that number has grown to 3.3% today, according to Gartner Distinguished Analyst Avivah Litan.\\n\\nMartha Bennett, a principal analyst for Forrester Research, noted any blockchain or \"DLT\" project is a long-term strategic initiative, and disappointment is inevitable \"when the hoped-for miracles fail to materialize.\"It\\'s not realistic to expect a solid cost model or definitive benefits statement because it\\'s simply too early for that,\" Bennett said. \"To assemble real evidence, we need to have a number of fully operationalized, scaled-out deployments running for at least a couple of years. And we\\'re simply not there yet.\"What is blockchain and how does it work?First and foremost, blockchain is a public electronic ledger built around a P2P system that can be openly shared among disparate users to create an unchangeable record of transactions, each time-stamped and linked to the previous one. Every time a set of transactions is added, that data becomes another block in the chain (hence, the name). Blockchain can only be updated by consensus between participants in the system, and once new data is entered it can never be erased. It is a write-once, append-many technology, making it a verifiable and auditable record of each and every transaction.While it has great potential, blockchain technology development is still early days; CIOs and their business counterparts should expect setbacks in deploying the technology, including the real possibility of\\xc2\\xa0serious bugs in the software\\xc2\\xa0used atop blockchain. And as some companies have already discovered, it\\'s not the be-all solution to many tech problems.Blockchain standards organizations, universities and start-ups\\xc2\\xa0have proposed newer consensus protocols and methods for spreading out the computational and data storage workload to enable greater transactional throughput and overall scalability \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a persistent problem for blockchain. \\xc2\\xa0And the Linux Foundation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Hyperledger Project\\xc2\\xa0has created modular tools\\xc2\\xa0for building out blockchain collaboration networks.While some industry groups are working toward standardizing versions of blockchain software, there are also hundreds of startups working on their own versions of the distributed ledger technology. IDG\\n\\nEach digital record or transaction in the electronic ledger is called a block. When a block is completed, it creates a unique secure code that ties it to the next block.\\n\\nWhy has blockchain been getting so much buzz? In a word, bitcoin \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the wildly hyped cryptocurrency that allows for payment transcations over an open network using encryption and without exposing the identities of individual bitcoin owners. It was the first ever decentralized one when it was created in 2009. Other forms of cryptocurrency or virtual money, such as\\xc2\\xa0Ether\\xc2\\xa0(based on the\\xc2\\xa0Ethereum blockchain application platform), have also gained significant traction and opened new venues for cross-border monetary exchanges.\\xc2\\xa0(Ethereum was introduced in 2013 by developer Vitalik Buterin, who was 19 at the time.)The term bitcoin was first... well, coined in 2008 when Satoshi Nakamoto (likely a pseudonym for one or more developers) wrote a paper about a \"peer-to-peer version of electronic cash that would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.\"For more than a year, however, Bitcoin has been on a roller coaster ride, with its value dropping from a peak of nearly $20,000 to a little more than $3,500, mainly due to the fact that it has no intrinsic value; its worth is based only on high demand and limited supply. Unlike fiat currencies or stocks, there is no institution or government backing the value of bitcoin.That may change for cryptocurrencies someday.Governments have already made overtures toward creating stablecoins, or cryptocurrency that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s backed by a stable asset such a gold or traditional fiat currency. Blockchain is also being used to digitize other assets, such as cars, real estate and even artwork. Forrester Research\\n\\nBlockchain, or distributed ledger technology, isn\\'t a single technology. Rather it\\'s an architecture that allows disparate users to make transactions and then creates an unchangeable, secure record of those transactions.\\n\\nPublic vs. private blockchainsAs a peer-to-peer network, combined with a distributed time-stamping server, public blockchain ledgers can be managed autonomously to exchange information between parties. There\\'s no need for an administrator. In effect, the blockchain users are the administrator.A second form of blockchain, known as private or permissioned blockchain, allows companies to create and centrally administer their own transactional networks that can be used inter- or intra-company with partners.Additionally, blockchain networks can be used for \"smart contracts,\" or scripts for business automation that execute when certain contractual conditions are met. For example,\\xc2\\xa0after a bad batch of lettuce\\xc2\\xa0resulted in customers becoming sick from e-coli, Walmart and IBM created a blockchain-based supply chain to track produce from farm to table. Walmart has asked its\\xc2\\xa0 produce suppliers to input their data to the blockchain database by September 2019. Once on the blockchain, produce can be automatically tracked through smart contracts from point to point, removing human intervention and error. IBM\\n\\nAfter piloting a blockchain-based produce supply chain tracking system, Walmart and Sam\\'s Club are telling suppliers to get their product data into the system so they can begin tracking produce from farm to store. The deadline: September 2019.\\n\\nDe Beers,which controls about 35% of the world\\'s diamond production,\\xc2\\xa0has also launched\\xc2\\xa0a blockchain-based supply chain to track diamonds for authenticity and to help ensure they aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t coming from war-torn regions where miners are exploited.Smart contracts can also be used to approve the transfer of assets, such as real estate. Once conditions are met between buyers, sellers and their financial institutions, property sales can be confirmed on DLT. For example, New York-based ShelterZoom this year is launching a real estate mobile application\\xc2\\xa0that lets real estate agents and clients see all offers and acceptances in real time online. It will also allow access to property titles, mortgages, legal and home inspection documents through the Ethereum-based encrypted blockchain ledger. TrustChain\\n\\nThe\\xc2\\xa0 De Beers\\'s TrustChain blockchain network will track and authenticate diamonds, precious metals and jewelry at all stages of the global supply chain, from the mine to the retailer.\\n\\nHow secure is blockchainWhile no system is \"unhackable,\" blockchain\\'s simple topology is the most secure today, according to Alex Tapscott, the CEO and founder of Northwest Passage Ventures, a venture capital firm that invests in blockchain technology companies.\"In order to move anything of value over any kind of blockchain, the network [of nodes] must first agree that that transaction is valid, which means no single entity can go in and say one way or the other whether or not a transaction happened,\" Tapscott said. \"To hack it, you wouldn\\'t just have to hack one system like in a bank..., you\\'d have to hack every single computer on that network, which is fighting against you doing that.\"So again, [it\\'s] not un-hackable, but significantly better than anything we\\'ve come up with today,\" he said.The computing resources needed for most blockchains are tremendous, Tapscott said, because of the number of computers involved. For example, the bitcoin blockchain harnesses anywhere between 10 and 100 times as much computing power as all of Google\\'s serving farms put together. Forrester Research\\n\\nAs with any emerging technology, blockchain faces challenges and barriers to adoption.\\n\\nBut even a larger scale can\\'t always prevent hacks.A recent \\xe2\\x80\\x9c51 percent attack\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on the Ethereum Classic token exchange showed why even blockchain is not impermeable to gaming. A 51 percent attack refers to a bad actor who gains control of the majority of CPUs in a cryptocurrency mining pool. Such attacks are generally limited to smaller blockchains with fewer nodes because they\\'re \\xc2\\xa0more susceptible to a single person seizing control based on a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. Computerworld / IDGEven though blockchain networks are secure, the applications running atop them may \\xc2\\xa0not be as safe, according to Bruce Schneier, a cryptographer and security expert.\"That\\'s not how this sort of thing will get broken. It\\'ll get broken because of some insecurity in the software,\" Schneier said.Blockchain\\'s advances rely on scalablityOne of the major issues facing blockchain involves scalability, or its ability to complete transactions in near real time, such as clearing payments via credit cards.Scalability has already been identified as an issue with cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and Ethereum\\'s Ether. If a distributed ledger is to achieve adoption by financial technology (FinTech) companies and compete with payment networks hundreds of times faster, it must find a way to boost scalability and throughput and address latency problems.Enter \"sharding.\"Sharding is one of several popular methods being explored by developers to increase transactional throughput. Simply stated,\\xc2\\xa0sharding is a way of partitioning\\xc2\\xa0to spread out the computational and storage workload across a P2P network so that each node isn\\'t responsible for processing the entire network\\'s transactional load. Instead, each node only maintains information related to its partition, or shard.The information contained in a shard can still be shared among other nodes, which keeps the ledger decentralized and theoretically secure because everyone can still see all ledger entries; they simply don\\'t process and store all of the information such as \\xc2\\xa0account balances and contract code, for instance.In today\\'s blockchains, each authenticating computer or node records\\xc2\\xa0all\\xc2\\xa0the data on the electronic ledger and is part of the consensus process. In large blockchains such as bitcoin, the majority of participating nodes must authenticate new transactions and record that information if they are to be added to the ledger; that makes completing each transaction slow and arduous.Because of that, bitcoin, which is based on a PoW, can only process 3.3 to 7 transactions per second \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and a single transaction can take 10 minutes to finalize.Ethereum, another popular blockchain ledger and cryptocurrency, is only able to process from 12 to 30 transactions per second.By comparison, Visa\\'s VisaNet on average processes 1,700 transactions per second.\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated: \\n\\nSecurity\\nStorage\\nFinancial Services Industry\\nBlockchain\\nICYMI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t    \\tPage 1\\n\\t\\t    \\nNext \\n\\n\\nPage 1 of 2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nToday\\'s best reads\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChat happens: Your guide to 10 group-chat services\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n10 tips for preventing Slack burnout\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n10 Smartsheet tips and tricks\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5 free and low-cost office suites that mean business\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTop 35 free apps for Windows 10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow to create an automatically updating Google sheet\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEasy way to bypass passcode lock screens on iPhones, iPads...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBlockchain in the real world: 3 enterprise use cases\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe evolution of Apple\\'s iPhone\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n20 great uses for an old Android device\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCurrently reading\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is blockchain?

Author of Artificial Intelligence and others.\\n\\n\\nSee Article History\\n\\n\\nAlternative Title:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nArtificial intelligence (AI),  the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Since the development of the digital computer in the 1940s, it has been demonstrated that computers can be programmed to carry out very complex tasks\\xe2\\x80\\x94as, for example, discovering proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chess\\xe2\\x80\\x94with great proficiency. Still, despite continuing advances in computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are as yet no programs that can match human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge. On the other hand, some programs have attained the performance levels of human experts and professionals in performing certain specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense is found in applications as diverse as medical diagnosis, computer search engines, and voice or handwriting recognition.\\nTop QuestionsWhat is artificial intelligence?Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of a computer or a robot controlled by a computer to do tasks that are usually done by humans because they require human intelligence and discernment.\\xc2\\xa0Although there are no AIs that can perform the wide variety of tasks an ordinary human can do, some AIs can match humans in specific tasks.Are artificial intelligence and machine learning the same?No, artificial intelligence and machine learning are not the same, but they are closely related. Machine learning is the method to train a computer to learn from its inputs but without explicit programming for every circumstance. Machine learning helps a computer to achieve artificial intelligence.\\nWhat is intelligence?\\nAll but the simplest human behaviour is ascribed to intelligence, while even the most complicated insect behaviour is never taken as an indication of intelligence. What is the difference? Consider the behaviour of the digger wasp, Sphex ichneumoneus. When the female wasp returns to her burrow with food, she first deposits it on the threshold, checks for intruders inside her burrow, and only then, if the coast is clear, carries her food inside. The real nature of the wasp\\xe2\\x80\\x99s instinctual behaviour is revealed if the food is moved a few inches away from the entrance to her burrow while she is inside: on emerging, she will repeat the whole procedure as often as the food is displaced. Intelligence\\xe2\\x80\\x94conspicuously absent in the case of Sphex\\xe2\\x80\\x94must include the ability to adapt to new circumstances.\\nPsychologists generally do not characterize human intelligence by just one trait but by the combination of many diverse abilities. Research in AI has focused chiefly on the following components of intelligence: learning, reasoning, problem solving, perception, and using language.\\nLearning\\nThere are a number of different forms of learning as applied to artificial intelligence. The simplest is learning by trial and error. For example, a simple computer program for solving mate-in-one chess problems might try moves at random until mate is found. The program might then store the solution with the position so that the next time the computer encountered the same position it would recall the solution. This simple memorizing of individual items and procedures\\xe2\\x80\\x94known as rote learning\\xe2\\x80\\x94is relatively easy to implement on a computer. More challenging is the problem of implementing what is called generalization. Generalization involves applying past experience to analogous new situations. For example, a program that learns the past tense of regular English verbs by rote will not be able to produce the past tense of a word such as jump unless it previously had been presented with jumped, whereas a program that is able to generalize can learn the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cadd ed\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rule and so form the past tense of jump based on experience with similar verbs.\\r\\nGet exclusive access to content from our 1768 First Edition with your subscription. \\r\\nSubscribe today\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nArtificial intelligence\\n\\nkey peopleMarvin Minsky Edward Albert Feigenbaum Allen Newell John McCarthy Alan Turing Ray Kurzweil Rodney Brooks Judea Pearl Raj Reddy Donald Michie related topicsComputer Science fiction Human intelligence Robot Computational aesthetics Neural network Artificial intelligence programming language Expert system Genetic algorithm Turing test\\n\\n\\n\\ndid you know?American companies possessed about two-thirds of investments in artificial intelligence as of 2016.

How Does AI Work?  32 Artificial Intelligence Companies Building a Smarter TomorrowThey may not be household names, but these 32 artificial intelligence companies are working on some very smart technology.  Read Article   The Future of Artificial Intelligence See More StoriesWhat is Artificial Intelligence?Artificial intelligence (AI) is wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that\\xc2\\xa0typically require human intelligence. AI is an interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches, but advancements in machine learning and deep learning\\xc2\\xa0are creating a paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the\\xc2\\xa0tech industry.\\xc2\\xa0How Does Artificial Intelligence Work?How is AI Used?History of AIHow Does Artificial Intelligence Work?Can machines think?\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Alan Turing, 1950Less than a decade after breaking the Nazi encryption machine Enigma and helping the Allied Forces win World War II, mathematician Alan Turing changed history a second time with a simple question: \"Can machines think?\"\\xc2\\xa0Turing\\'s paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\" (1950), and it\\'s subsequent Turing Test, established the fundamental goal and vision of artificial intelligence.\\xc2\\xa0 \\xc2\\xa0At it\\'s core, AI is the branch of computer science that aims to answer Turing\\'s question in the affirmative. It is the endeavor to replicate or simulate human intelligence in machines.The expansive goal of artificial intelligence has given rise to many\\xc2\\xa0questions and debates. So much so, that no singular definition of the field is universally accepted. \\xc2\\xa0The major limitation in defining AI as simply \"building machines that are intelligent\" is that it doesn\\'t actually explain what artificial intelligence is? What makes a machine intelligent?In their groundbreaking textbook Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, authors Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig approach the question by unifying their work around the theme of intelligent agents in machines. With this in mind, AI is \"the study of agents that receive percepts from the environment and perform actions.\" (Russel and Norvig viii)Norvig and Russell go on to explore four different approaches that have historically defined the field of AI:\\xc2\\xa0Thinking humanlyThinking rationallyActing humanly\\xc2\\xa0Acting rationallyThe first two ideas concern thought processes and reasoning, while the others deal with behavior. Norvig and Russell focus particularly on rational agents that act to achieve the best outcome, noting \"all the skills needed for the Turing Test also allow an agent to act rationally.\" (Russel and Norvig 4).Patrick Winston, the Ford professor of artificial intelligence and computer science at MIT, defines AI as\\xc2\\xa0 \"algorithms enabled by constraints, exposed by representations that support models targeted at loops that tie thinking, perception and action together.\"While these definitions may seem abstract to the average person, they help focus the field as an area of computer science and provide a blueprint for infusing machines and programs with machine learning and other subsets of artificial intelligence.\\xc2\\xa0While addressing a crowd at the Japan AI Experience in 2017,\\xc2\\xa0 DataRobot CEO Jeremy Achin began his speech by offering the following definition of how AI is used today:\"AI is a computer system able to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence... Many of these artificial intelligence systems are powered by machine learning, some of them are powered by deep learning and some of them are powered by very boring things like rules.\"\\xc2\\xa0Check Out the Top Companies in the Nation\\'s Hottest AI Hubs\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0How is AI Used?Artificial intelligence generally falls under two broad categories:\\xc2\\xa0Narrow AI: Sometimes referred to as \"Weak AI,\" this kind of artificial\\xc2\\xa0intelligence operates within a limited\\xc2\\xa0context and is a simulation of\\xc2\\xa0human intelligence. Narrow AI is often focused on\\xc2\\xa0performing a single task extremely well and while these machines may seem intelligent, they are operating under far more constraints and limitations than even the most basic human intelligence.\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): AGI, sometimes referred to as \"Strong AI,\" is the kind of artificial intelligence we see in the movies, like the robots from\\xc2\\xa0Westworld\\xc2\\xa0or Data from\\xc2\\xa0Star Trek: The Next Generation. AGI is a machine with general intelligence\\xc2\\xa0and, much like a human being, it can apply that intelligence to solve any problem.\\xc2\\xa0Artificial Intelligence ExamplesSmart assistants (like Siri and Alexa)Disease mapping and prediction toolsManufacturing and drone robotsOptimized, personalized healthcare treatment recommendationsConversational bots for marketing and customer serviceRobo-advisors for stock tradingSpam filters on emailSocial media monitoring tools for dangerous content or false newsSong or TV show recommendations from Spotify and NetflixNarrow Artificial IntelligenceNarrow AI is all around us and is easily the most successful realization of artificial intelligence to date. With its focus on performing specific tasks, Narrow AI has experienced numerous breakthroughs in the last decade that have had \"significant societal benefits and have contributed to the economic vitality of the nation,\" according to \"Preparing for the Future of Artificial Intelligence,\" a 2016 report released by the Obama Administration.\\xc2\\xa0A few examples of Narrow AI include:\\xc2\\xa0Google searchImage recognition softwareSiri, Alexa and other personal assistantsSelf-driving carsIBM\\'s Watson\\xc2\\xa0Machine Learning & Deep Learning\\xc2\\xa0Much of Narrow AI is powered by breakthroughs in machine learning and deep learning. Understanding the difference between artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning can be confusing. Venture capitalist Frank Chen provides a good overview of how to distinguish between them, noting:\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\"Artificial intelligence is a set of algorithms and intelligence to try to mimic human intelligence. Machine learning is one of them, and deep learning is one of those machine learning techniques.\"\\xc2\\xa0Simply put, machine learning feeds a computer data and uses statistical techniques to help it \"learn\" how to get progressively better at a task, without having been specifically programmed for that task, eliminating the need for millions of lines of written code.\\xc2\\xa0Machine learning consists of both supervised learning (using labeled\\xc2\\xa0data sets) and unsupervised learning (using unlabeled data sets).\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through a biologically-inspired neural network architecture. The neural networks contain a number of hidden layers through which the data is processed, allowing the machine to go \"deep\" in its learning, making connections and weighting input for the best results.Artificial General IntelligenceThe creation of a machine with human-level intelligence that can be applied to any task is the Holy Grail for many AI researchers, but the quest for AGI has been fraught with difficulty.\\xc2\\xa0The search for a \"universal algorithm for learning and acting in any environment,\"\\xc2\\xa0(Russel and Norvig 27) isn\\'t new, but time hasn\\'t eased the difficulty of essentially creating a machine with a full set of cognitive abilities.\\xc2\\xa0AGI has long been the muse\\xc2\\xa0of dystopian science fiction, in which super-intelligent robots overrun humanity,\\xc2\\xa0but experts agree it\\'s not something we need to worry about anytime soon.History of AIIntelligent robots and artificial beings\\xc2\\xa0first appeared in the ancient Greek myths of Antiquity. Aristotle\\'s development of the syllogism and it\\'s use of deductive reasoning was a key moment in mankind\\'s quest to understand its own intelligence. While the roots are long and deep, the history of artificial intelligence as we think of it today spans less than a century. The following\\xc2\\xa0is a quick look at some of the most important events in AI.\\xc2\\xa01943Warren McCullough and Walter\\xc2\\xa0Pitts publish\\xc2\\xa0\"A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity.\" The paper proposed the first mathematic model for building a neural network.\\xc2\\xa01949In his\\xc2\\xa0book\\xc2\\xa0The Organization of Behavior: A Neuropsychological Theory, Donald Hebb proposes the theory that neural pathways are created from experiences and that connections between neurons become stronger the more frequently they\\'re used. Hebbian learning continues to be an important model in AI.1950Alan Turing publishes \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence, proposing what is now known as the Turing Test, a method for determining if a machine is intelligent.\\xc2\\xa0Harvard undergraduates Marvin Minsky and Dean Edmonds build SNARC, the first neural network computer.Claude Shannon publishes the paper \"Programming a Computer for Playing Chess.\"Isaac Asimov publishes the \"Three Laws of Robotics.\"\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa01952Arthur Samuel\\xc2\\xa0develops a self-learning program to play checkers.\\xc2\\xa01954The Georgetown-IBM machine translation experiment automatically translates 60 carefully selected Russian sentences into English.\\xc2\\xa01956The phrase artificial intelligence is coined at the \"Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence.\" Led by John McCarthy, the conference, which defined the scope and goals of AI,\\xc2\\xa0is widely considered to be the birth of artificial intelligence as we know it today.\\xc2\\xa0Allen Newell and Herbert Simon demonstrate Logic Theorist (LT), the first reasoning program.\\xc2\\xa01958John McCarthy develops the AI programming language Lisp and publishes the paper \"Programs with Common Sense.\" The paper proposed the hypothetical Advice Taker, a complete AI system with the ability to learn from experience as effectively as humans do.\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa01959Allen Newell, Herbert Simon and J.C. Shaw develop the General Problem Solver (GPS), a program designed to imitate human problem-solving.\\xc2\\xa0Herbert Gelernter develops the Geometry Theorem Prover program.Arthur Samuel\\xc2\\xa0coins the term machine learning while at IBM.John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky found the MIT Artificial Intelligence Project.1963John McCarthy starts the AI Lab at Stanford.1966The Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee (ALPAC) report by the U.S. government details the lack of progress in machine translations research, a major Cold War initiative with the promise of automatic and instantaneous translation of Russian. The ALPAC report leads to the cancellation of all government-funded MT projects.\\xc2\\xa01969The first successful expert systems are developed in DENDRAL, a XX program, and MYCIN, designed to diagnose blood infections, are created at Stanford.1972The logic programming language PROLOG is created.1973The \"Lighthill Report,\" detailing the disappointments in AI research, is released by the British government and leads to severe cuts in funding for artificial intelligence projects.\\xc2\\xa01974-1980Frustration with the progress of AI development leads to major DARPA cutbacks in academic grants.

Here\\'s everything you need to know.\\nCalum McClelland -July 2, 2020\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProbably, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard that the Internet of Things has the power to drastically change our lives, from how we manage and operate our homes to even automating jobs across nearly all industries. But what is IoT actually? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been asked that question more times than I can count and, over the past several years, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve boiled the answer down to something that I think anyone can understand. In this article, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to share everything you need to know about the Internet of Things.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is IoT?\\xe2\\x80\\x9dIf you just Google \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat is IoT?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, many of the answers are unnecessarily technical. Case in point:\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94An unnecessarily technical explanation of IoTIf you just read that and thought, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cok\\xe2\\x80\\xa6what?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not alone. Most people neither want nor to need to dive into the nitty-gritty of IoT. So in this post, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll provide you with a simple explanation of the Internet of Things and how it may impact you. This can also serve as a resource to share with others who need an introduction to IoT (like friends, family members, or customers).Before we jump in, note that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Internet of Things\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIoT\\xe2\\x80\\x9d can and will be used interchangeably. And a quick tip: avoid saying \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe IoT.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dThe Internet of Things (IoT) Explained: Simply and Non-TechnicallyHow are you reading this post right now?\\xc2\\xa0It might be on desktop, on mobile, maybe a tablet, but whatever device you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re using, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\xc2\\xa0most definitely connected to the internet.An internet connection is a wonderful thing, it\\xc2\\xa0give us all sorts of benefits that just weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t possible before. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re old enough, think of your cellphone before it was a smartphone. You could call and you could text sure, but now you can read any book, watch any movie, or listen to any song all in the palm of your hand. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just to name a few of the incredible things your smartphone can do.Image Credit: SamsungConnecting things to the internet yields many amazing benefits.\\xc2\\xa0We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve all seen these benefits with our smartphones, laptops, and tablets, but this is true for everything else too. And yes, I do mean everything.The Internet of Things is actually a pretty simple concept, it means taking all the things in the world and connecting them to the internet.I think that confusion arises not because the concept is so narrow and tightly defined, but rather because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so broad and loosely defined. It can be hard to nail down the concept in your head when there are so many examples and possibilities in\\xc2\\xa0IoT.To help clarify, I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important\\xc2\\xa0to understand the benefits of connecting things to the internet. Why would we even want to connect everything to the internet?Why IoT MattersWhen something is connected to the internet, that means that it can send information or receive information, or both. This ability to send and/or receive information\\xc2\\xa0makes things smart, and smart is good.Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s use smartphones (smartphones) again as an example. Right now you can listen to just about any song in the world, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not because your phone actually has every song in the world stored on it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because every song in the world is stored somewhere else, but your phone can send information (asking for that song) and then receive information (streaming that song on your phone).To be smart, a thing doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to have\\xc2\\xa0super storage or a supercomputer inside of it. All a thing has to do is connect to super storage or to a supercomputer. Being connected is awesome.In the Internet of Things, all the things that are being connected to the internet can be put into three categories:Things that collect information and then send\\xc2\\xa0it.Things that receive\\xc2\\xa0information and then act\\xc2\\xa0on it.Things that do\\xc2\\xa0both.And all three of these have enormous benefits that feed on each other.1. Collecting and Sending InformationThis means sensors. Sensors could be temperature sensors, motion sensors, moisture sensors, air quality sensors, light sensors, you name it. These sensors, along with a connection, allow us to automatically collect information\\xc2\\xa0from the environment which, in turn, allows us to make more intelligent decisions.(Soil moisture sensor) Image Credit: SparkfunOn the farm, automatically getting information about the soil moisture can\\xc2\\xa0tell farmers exactly when their crops need to be watered. Instead of watering too much (which can be an expensive over-use of irrigation systems and environmentally wasteful) or watering too little (which can be an expensive loss of crops), the farmer can ensure that crops get exactly the right amount of water. More money for farmers and more food for the world!Just as our sight, hearing, smell, touch, and taste\\xc2\\xa0allow us, humans, to make sense of the world, sensors allow machines to make sense of the world.2. Receiving and Acting on InformationWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all very familiar with machines getting information and then acting. Your printer receives a document and it prints it. Your car receives a signal from your car keys and the doors open. The examples are endless.Whether it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a simple as sending the command \\xe2\\x80\\x9cturn on\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or as complex\\xc2\\xa0as sending a 3D model to a 3D printer, we know that we can tell machines what to do from far away. So what?The real power of the Internet of Things arises when things can do both of the above. Things that collect information and send it, but also receive information and act on it.3. Doing BothLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s quickly go back to the farming example. The sensors can collect\\xc2\\xa0information about the soil moisture to tell the farmer how much to water the crops, but you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t actually need the farmer. Instead, the irrigation system can automatically turn on as needed, based on how much moisture is in the soil.Image Credit: Everything ConnectsYou can take it a step further too. If the irrigation system receives information about the weather from its internet connection, it can also know when it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to rain and decide not to water the crops today because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be watered by the rain anyways.And it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stop there! All this information about the soil moisture, how much the irrigation system is watering the crops, and how well the crops actually grow can be collected and sent to supercomputers that run\\xc2\\xa0amazing\\xc2\\xa0algorithms that can make sense of all this information.And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just one kind of sensor. Add in other sensors like light, air quality, and temperature, and these algorithms can learn much much more. With dozens, hundreds, thousands of farms all collecting this information, these algorithms can create incredible insights into how to make crops grow the best, helping to feed the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s growing population.Your Takeaway Definition of IoTWhat is IoT?: The internet of Things, or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIoT\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for short, is about extending the power of the internet beyond computers and smartphones to a whole range of other things, processes, and environments. Those \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconnected\\xe2\\x80\\x9d things are used to gather information, send information back, or both.Why does IoT matter?: IoT provides businesses and people better insight into and control over the 99 percent of objects and environments that remain beyond the reach of the internet. And by doing so, IoT allows businesses and people to be more connected to the world around them and to do more meaningful, higher-level work.Want to Learn More About IoT?I promised to keep this simple and non-technical, so I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll stop there and leave you with two takeaways: a super simple takeaway definition of IoT and a free eBook with which you can deepen that definition if you want to.

Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of \"intelligent agents\": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.[1] Colloquially, the term \"artificial intelligence\" is often used to describe machines (or computers) that mimic \"cognitive\" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as \"learning\" and \"problem solving\".[2]\\nAs machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require \"intelligence\" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect.[3] A quip in Tesler\\'s Theorem says \"AI is whatever hasn\\'t been done yet.\"[4] For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI,[5] having become a routine technology.[6] Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech,[7] competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go),[8] autonomously operating cars, intelligent routing in content delivery networks, and military simulations.[9]\\nArtificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1955, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism,[10][11] followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an \"AI winter\"),[12][13] followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding.[11][14] For most of its history, AI research has been divided into sub-fields that often fail to communicate with each other.[15] These sub-fields are based on technical considerations, such as particular goals (e.g. \"robotics\" or \"machine learning\"),[16] the use of particular tools (\"logic\" or artificial neural networks), or deep philosophical differences.[17][18][19] Sub-fields have also been based on social factors (particular institutions or the work of particular researchers).[15]\\nThe traditional problems (or goals) of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects.[16] General intelligence is among the field\\'s long-term goals.[20] Approaches include statistical methods, computational intelligence, and traditional symbolic AI. Many tools are used in AI, including versions of search and mathematical optimization, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability and economics. The AI field draws upon computer science, information engineering, mathematics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.\\nThe field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence \"can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it\".[21] This raises philosophical arguments about the mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence. These issues have been explored by myth, fiction and philosophy since antiquity.[22] Some people also consider AI to be a danger to humanity if it progresses unabated.[23][24] Others believe that AI, unlike previous technological revolutions, will create a risk of mass unemployment.[25]\\nIn the twenty-first century, AI techniques have experienced a resurgence following concurrent advances in computer power, large amounts of data, and theoretical understanding; and AI techniques have become an essential part of the technology industry, helping to solve many challenging problems in computer science, software engineering and operations research.[26][14]\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 History\\n2 Definitions\\n3 Basics\\n4 Challenges\\n\\n4.1 Reasoning, problem solving\\n4.2 Knowledge representation\\n4.3 Planning\\n4.4 Learning\\n4.5 Natural language processing\\n4.6 Perception\\n4.7 Motion and manipulation\\n4.8 Social intelligence\\n4.9 General intelligence\\n\\n\\n5 Approaches\\n\\n5.1 Cybernetics and brain simulation\\n5.2 Symbolic\\n\\n5.2.1 Cognitive simulation\\n5.2.2 Logic-based\\n5.2.3 Anti-logic or scruffy\\n5.2.4 Knowledge-based\\n\\n\\n5.3 Sub-symbolic\\n\\n5.3.1 Embodied intelligence\\n5.3.2 Computational intelligence and soft computing\\n\\n\\n5.4 Statistical learning\\n5.5 Integrating the approaches\\n\\n\\n6 Tools\\n\\n6.1 Search and optimization\\n6.2 Logic\\n6.3 Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning\\n6.4 Classifiers and statistical learning methods\\n6.5 Artificial neural networks\\n\\n6.5.1 Deep feedforward neural networks\\n6.5.2 Deep recurrent neural networks\\n\\n\\n6.6 Evaluating progress\\n\\n6.6.1 Hardware improvements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n7 Applications\\n\\n7.1 Healthcare\\n7.2 Automotive\\n7.3 Finance and economics\\n7.4 Cybersecurity\\n7.5 Government\\n7.6 Law-related professions\\n7.7 Video games\\n7.8 Military\\n7.9 Hospitality\\n7.10 Audit\\n7.11 Advertising\\n7.12 Art\\n\\n\\n8 Philosophy and ethics\\n\\n8.1 The limits of artificial general intelligence\\n8.2 Potential harm\\n\\n8.2.1 Existential risk\\n8.2.2 Devaluation of humanity\\n8.2.3 Social justice\\n8.2.4 Decrease in demand for human labor\\n8.2.5 Autonomous weapons\\n\\n\\n8.3 Ethical machines\\n\\n8.3.1 Artificial moral agents\\n8.3.2 Machine ethics\\n8.3.3 Malevolent and friendly AI\\n\\n\\n8.4 Machine consciousness, sentience and mind\\n\\n8.4.1 Consciousness\\n8.4.2 Computationalism and functionalism\\n8.4.3 Strong AI hypothesis\\n8.4.4 Robot rights\\n\\n\\n8.5 Superintelligence\\n\\n8.5.1 Technological singularity\\n8.5.2 Transhumanism\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n9 Economics\\n10 Regulation\\n11 In fiction\\n12 See also\\n13 Explanatory notes\\n14 References\\n\\n14.1 AI textbooks\\n14.2 History of AI\\n14.3 Other sources\\n\\n\\n15 Further reading\\n16 External links\\n\\n\\n\\nHistory\\nMain articles: History of artificial intelligence and Timeline of artificial intelligence\\n Silver didrachma from Crete depicting Talos, an ancient mythical automaton with artificial intelligence\\nThought-capable artificial beings appeared as storytelling devices in antiquity,[27] and have been common in fiction, as in Mary Shelley\\'s Frankenstein or Karel \\xc4\\x8capek\\'s R.U.R. (Rossum\\'s Universal Robots).[28] These characters and their fates raised many of the same issues now discussed in the ethics of artificial intelligence.[22]\\nThe study of mechanical or \"formal\" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of mathematical logic led directly to Alan Turing\\'s theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as \"0\" and \"1\", could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction. This insight, that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning, is known as the Church\\xe2\\x80\\x93Turing thesis.[29] Along with concurrent discoveries in neurobiology, information theory and cybernetics, this led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain. Turing proposed changing the question from whether a machine was intelligent, to \"whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour\".[30] The first work that is now generally recognized as AI was McCullouch and Pitts\\' 1943 formal design for Turing-complete \"artificial neurons\".[31]\\nThe field of AI research was born at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956,[32] where the term \"Artificial Intelligence\" was coined by John McCarthy to distinguish the field from cybernetics and escape the influence of the cyberneticist Norbert Wiener.[33] Attendees Allen Newell (CMU), Herbert Simon (CMU), John McCarthy (MIT), Marvin Minsky (MIT) and Arthur Samuel (IBM) became the founders and leaders of AI research.[34] They and their students produced programs that the press described as \"astonishing\":[35] computers were learning checkers strategies (c. 1954)[36] (and by 1959 were reportedly playing better than the average human),[37] solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems (Logic Theorist, first run c. 1956) and speaking English.[38] By the middle of the 1960s, research in the U.S. was heavily funded by the Department of Defense[39] and laboratories had been established around the world.[40] AI\\'s founders were optimistic about the future: Herbert Simon predicted, \"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do\". Marvin Minsky agreed, writing, \"within a generation\\xc2\\xa0... the problem of creating \\'artificial intelligence\\' will substantially be solved\".[10]\\nThey failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the remaining tasks. Progress slowed and in 1974, in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill[41] and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to fund more productive projects, both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in AI. The next few years would later be called an \"AI winter\",[12] a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult.\\nIn the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems,[42] a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan\\'s fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S and British governments to restore funding for academic research.[11] However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting hiatus began.[13]\\nThe development of metal\\xe2\\x80\\x93oxide\\xe2\\x80\\x93semiconductor (MOS) very-large-scale integration (VLSI), in the form of complementary MOS (CMOS) transistor technology, enabled the development of practical artificial neural network (ANN) technology in the 1980s. A landmark publication in the field was the 1989 book Analog VLSI Implementation of Neural Systems by Carver A. Mead and Mohammed Ismail.[43]\\nIn the late 1990s and early 21st century, AI began to be used for logistics, data mining, medical diagnosis and other areas.[26] The success was due to increasing computational power (see Moore\\'s law and transistor count), greater emphasis on solving specific problems, new ties between AI and other fields (such as statistics, economics and mathematics), and a commitment by researchers to mathematical methods and scientific standards.[44] Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, on 11 May 1997.[45]\\nIn 2011, a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM\\'s question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin.[46] Faster computers, algorithmic improvements, and access to large amounts of data enabled advances in machine learning and perception; data-hungry deep learning methods started to dominate accuracy benchmarks around 2012.[47] The Kinect, which provides a 3D body\\xe2\\x80\\x93motion interface for the Xbox 360 and the Xbox One, uses algorithms that emerged from lengthy AI research[48] as do intelligent personal assistants in smartphones.[49] In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol, becoming the first computer Go-playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps.[8][50] In the 2017 Future of Go Summit, AlphaGo won a three-game match with Ke Jie,[51] who at the time continuously held the world No. 1 ranking for two years.[52][53] This marked the completion of a significant milestone in the development of Artificial Intelligence as Go is a relatively complex game, more so than Chess.\\nAccording to Bloomberg\\'s Jack Clark, 2015 was a landmark year for artificial intelligence, with the number of software projects that use AI Google increased from a \"sporadic usage\" in 2012 to more than 2,700 projects. Clark also presents factual data indicating the improvements of AI since 2012 supported by lower error rates in image processing tasks.[54] He attributes this to an increase in affordable neural networks, due to a rise in cloud computing infrastructure and to an increase in research tools and datasets.[14] Other cited examples include Microsoft\\'s development of a Skype system that can automatically translate from one language to another and Facebook\\'s system that can describe images to blind people.[54] In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported they had \"incorporated AI in some offerings or processes\".[55][56] Around 2016, China greatly accelerated its government funding; given its large supply of data and its rapidly increasing research output, some observers believe it may be on track to becoming an \"AI superpower\".[57][58] However, it has been acknowledged that reports regarding artificial intelligence have tended to be exaggerated.[59][60][61]\\n\\nDefinitions\\nComputer science defines AI research as the study of \"intelligent agents\": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.[1] A more elaborate definition characterizes AI as \"a system\\'s ability to correctly interpret external data, to learn from such data, and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation.\"[62]\\n\\nBasics\\nA typical AI analyzes its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success.[1] An AI\\'s intended utility function (or goal) can be simple (\"1 if the AI wins a game of Go, 0 otherwise\") or complex (\"Perform actions mathematically similar to ones that succeeded in the past\"). Goals can be explicitly defined or induced. If the AI is programmed for \"reinforcement learning\", goals can be implicitly induced by rewarding some types of behavior or punishing others.[a] Alternatively, an evolutionary system can induce goals by using a \"fitness function\" to mutate and preferentially replicate high-scoring AI systems, similar to how animals evolved to innately desire certain goals such as finding food.[63] Some AI systems, such as nearest-neighbor, instead of reason by analogy, these systems are not generally given goals, except to the degree that goals are implicit in their training data.[64] Such systems can still be benchmarked if the non-goal system is framed as a system whose \"goal\" is to successfully accomplish its narrow classification task.[65]\\nAI often revolves around the use of algorithms. An algorithm is a set of unambiguous instructions that a mechanical computer can execute.[b] A complex algorithm is often built on top of other, simpler, algorithms. A simple example of an algorithm is the following (optimal for first player) recipe for play at tic-tac-toe:[66]\\n\\nIf someone has a \"threat\" (that is, two in a row), take the remaining square. Otherwise,\\nif a move \"forks\" to create two threats at once, play that move. Otherwise,\\ntake the center square if it is free. Otherwise,\\nif your opponent has played in a corner, take the opposite corner. Otherwise,\\ntake an empty corner if one exists. Otherwise,\\ntake any empty square.\\nMany AI algorithms are capable of learning from data; they can enhance themselves by learning new heuristics (strategies, or \"rules of thumb\", that have worked well in the past), or can themselves write other algorithms. Some of the \"learners\" described below, including Bayesian networks, decision trees, and nearest-neighbor, could theoretically, (given infinite data, time, and memory) learn to approximate any function, including which combination of mathematical functions would best describe the world[citation needed]. These learners could therefore derive all possible knowledge, by considering every possible hypothesis and matching them against the data. In practice, it is seldom possible to consider every possibility, because of the phenomenon of \"combinatorial explosion\", where the time needed to solve a problem grows exponentially. Much of AI research involves figuring out how to identify and avoid considering a broad range of possibilities unlikely to be beneficial.[67][68] For example, when viewing a map and looking for the shortest driving route from Denver to New York in the East, one can in most cases skip looking at any path through San Francisco or other areas far to the West; thus, an AI wielding a pathfinding algorithm like A* can avoid the combinatorial explosion that would ensue if every possible route had to be ponderously considered.[69]\\nThe earliest (and easiest to understand) approach to AI was symbolism (such as formal logic): \"If an otherwise healthy adult has a fever, then they may have influenza\". A second, more general, approach is Bayesian inference: \"If the current patient has a fever, adjust the probability they have influenza in such-and-such way\". The third major approach, extremely popular in routine business AI applications, are analogizers such as SVM and nearest-neighbor: \"After examining the records of known past patients whose temperature, symptoms, age, and other factors mostly match the current patient, X% of those patients turned out to have influenza\". A fourth approach is harder to intuitively understand, but is inspired by how the brain\\'s machinery works: the artificial neural network approach uses artificial \"neurons\" that can learn by comparing itself to the desired output and altering the strengths of the connections between its internal neurons to \"reinforce\" connections that seemed to be useful. These four main approaches can overlap with each other and with evolutionary systems; for example, neural nets can learn to make inferences, to generalize, and to make analogies. Some systems implicitly or explicitly use multiple of these approaches, alongside many other AI and non-AI algorithms; the best approach is often different depending on the problem.[70][71]\\nLearning algorithms work on the basis that strategies, algorithms, and inferences that worked well in the past are likely to continue working well in the future. These inferences can be obvious, such as \"since the sun rose every morning for the last 10,000 days, it will probably rise tomorrow morning as well\". They can be nuanced, such as \"X% of families have geographically separate species with color variants, so there is a Y% chance that undiscovered black swans exist\". Learners also work on the basis of \"Occam\\'s razor\": The simplest theory that explains the data is the likeliest. Therefore, according to Occam\\'s razor principle, a learner must be designed such that it prefers simpler theories to complex theories, except in cases where the complex theory is proven substantially better.\\n\\n The blue line could be an example of overfitting a linear function due to random noise.\\nSettling on a bad, overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as overfitting. Many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data, but penalizing the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is.[72] Besides classic overfitting, learners can also disappoint by \"learning the wrong lesson\". A toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses.[73] A real-world example is that, unlike humans, current image classifiers don\\'t determine the spatial relationship between components of the picture; instead, they learn abstract patterns of pixels that humans are oblivious to, but that linearly correlate with images of certain types of real objects. Faintly superimposing such a pattern on a legitimate image results in an \"adversarial\" image that the system misclassifies.[c][74][75][76]\\n\\n A self-driving car system may use a neural network to determine which parts of the picture seem to match previous training images of pedestrians, and then model those areas as slow-moving but somewhat unpredictable rectangular prisms that must be avoided.[77][78]\\nCompared with humans, existing AI lacks several features of human \"commonsense reasoning\"; most notably, humans have powerful mechanisms for reasoning about \"na\\xc3\\xafve physics\" such as space, time, and physical interactions. This enables even young children to easily make inferences like \"If I roll this pen off a table, it will fall on the floor\". Humans also have a powerful mechanism of \"folk psychology\" that helps them to interpret natural-language sentences such as \"The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they advocated violence\". (A generic AI has difficulty discerning whether the ones alleged to be advocating violence are the councilmen or the demonstrators.)[79][80][81] This lack of \"common knowledge\" means that AI often makes different mistakes than humans make, in ways that can seem incomprehensible. For example, existing self-driving cars cannot reason about the location nor the intentions of pedestrians in the exact way that humans do, and instead must use non-human modes of reasoning to avoid accidents.[82][83][84]\\n\\nChallenges\\nThe cognitive capabilities of current architectures are very limited, using only a simplified version of what intelligence is really capable of. For instance, the human mind has come up with ways to reason beyond measure and logical explanations to different occurrences in life. What would have been otherwise straightforward, an equivalently difficult problem may be challenging to solve computationally as opposed to using the human mind. This gives rise to two classes of models: structuralist and functionalist. The structural models aim to loosely mimic the basic intelligence operations of the mind such as reasoning and logic. The functional model refers to the correlating data to its computed counterpart.[85]\\nThe overall research goal of artificial intelligence is to create technology that allows computers and machines to function in an intelligent manner. The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention.[16]\\n\\nReasoning, problem solving\\nEarly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions.[86] By the late 1980s and 1990s, AI research had developed methods for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.[87]\\nThese algorithms proved to be insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experienced a \"combinatorial explosion\": they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger.[67] Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.[88]\\n\\nKnowledge representation\\n An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts.\\nMain articles: Knowledge representation and Commonsense knowledge\\nKnowledge representation[89] and knowledge engineering[90] are central to classical AI research. Some \"expert systems\" attempt to gather explicit knowledge possessed by experts in some narrow domain. In addition, some projects attempt to gather the \"commonsense knowledge\" known to the average person into a database containing extensive knowledge about the world. Among the things a comprehensive commonsense knowledge base would contain are: objects, properties, categories and relations between objects;[91] situations, events, states and time;[92] causes and effects;[93] knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);[94] and many other, less well researched domains. A representation of \"what exists\" is an ontology: the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties formally described so that software agents can interpret them. The semantics of these are captured as description logic concepts, roles, and individuals, and typically implemented as classes, properties, and individuals in the Web Ontology Language.[95] The most general ontologies are called upper ontologies, which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge[96] by acting as mediators between domain ontologies that cover specific knowledge about a particular knowledge domain (field of interest or area of concern). Such formal knowledge representations can be used in content-based indexing and retrieval,[97] scene interpretation,[98] clinical decision support,[99] knowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large databases),[100] and other areas.[101]\\nAmong the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are:\\n\\nDefault reasoning and the qualification problem\\nMany of the things people know take the form of \"working assumptions\". For example, if a bird comes up in conversation, people typically picture a fist-sized animal that sings and flies. None of these things are true about all birds. John McCarthy identified this problem in 1969[102] as the qualification problem: for any commonsense rule that AI researchers care to represent, there tend to be a huge number of exceptions. Almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires. AI research has explored a number of solutions to this problem.[103]\\nBreadth of commonsense knowledge\\nThe number of atomic facts that the average person knows is very large. Research projects that attempt to build a complete knowledge base of commonsense knowledge (e.g., Cyc) require enormous amounts of laborious ontological engineering\\xe2\\x80\\x94they must be built, by hand, one complicated concept at a time.[104]\\nSubsymbolic form of some commonsense knowledge\\nMuch of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally. For example, a chess master will avoid a particular chess position because it \"feels too exposed\"[105] or an art critic can take one look at a statue and realize that it is a fake.[106] These are non-conscious and sub-symbolic intuitions or tendencies in the human brain.[107] Knowledge like this informs, supports and provides a context for symbolic, conscious knowledge. As with the related problem of sub-symbolic reasoning, it is hoped that situated AI, computational intelligence, or statistical AI will provide ways to represent this knowledge.[107]\\nPlanning\\n A hierarchical control system is a form of control system in which a set of devices and governing software is arranged in a hierarchy.\\nMain article: Automated planning and scheduling\\nIntelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them.[108] They need a way to visualize the future\\xe2\\x80\\x94a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it\\xe2\\x80\\x94and be able to make choices that maximize the utility (or \"value\") of available choices.[109]\\nIn classical planning problems, the agent can assume that it is the only system acting in the world, allowing the agent to be certain of the consequences of its actions.[110] However, if the agent is not the only actor, then it requires that the agent can reason under uncertainty. This calls for an agent that can not only assess its environment and make predictions but also evaluate its predictions and adapt based on its assessment.[111]\\nMulti-agent planning uses the cooperation and competition of many agents to achieve a given goal. Emergent behavior such as this is used by evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence.[112]\\n\\nLearning\\nMain article: Machine learning\\nMachine learning (ML), a fundamental concept of AI research since the field\\'s inception,[113] is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.[114][115]\\nUnsupervised learning is the ability to find patterns in a stream of input, without requiring a human to label the inputs first. Supervised learning includes both classification and numerical regression, which requires a human to label the input data first. Classification is used to determine what category something belongs in, and occurs after a program sees a number of examples of things from several categories. Regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change.[115] Both classifiers and regression learners can be viewed as \"function approximators\" trying to learn an unknown (possibly implicit) function; for example, a spam classifier can be viewed as learning a function that maps from the text of an email to one of two categories, \"spam\" or \"not spam\". Computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity, by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization.[116] In reinforcement learning[117] the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent uses this sequence of rewards and punishments to form a strategy for operating in its problem space.\\n\\nNatural language processing\\n A parse tree represents the syntactic structure of a sentence according to some formal grammar.\\nMain article: Natural language processing\\nNatural language processing[118] (NLP) allows machines to read and understand human language. A sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would enable natural-language user interfaces and the acquisition of knowledge directly from human-written sources, such as newswire texts. Some straightforward applications of natural language processing include information retrieval, text mining, question answering[119] and machine translation.[120] Many current approaches use word co-occurrence frequencies to construct syntactic representations of text. \"Keyword spotting\" strategies for search are popular and scalable but dumb; a search query for \"dog\" might only match documents with the literal word \"dog\" and miss a document with the word \"poodle\". \"Lexical affinity\" strategies use the occurrence of words such as \"accident\" to assess the sentiment of a document. Modern statistical NLP approaches can combine all these strategies as well as others, and often achieve acceptable accuracy at the page or paragraph level. Beyond semantic NLP, the ultimate goal of \"narrative\" NLP is to embody a full understanding of commonsense reasoning.[121] By 2019, transformer-based deep learning architectures could generate coherent text.[122]\\n\\nPerception\\nMain articles: Machine perception, Computer vision, and Speech recognition\\n Feature detection (pictured: edge detection) helps AI compose informative abstract structures out of raw data.\\nMachine perception[123] is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras (visible spectrum or infrared), microphones, wireless signals, and active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world. Applications include speech recognition,[124] facial recognition, and object recognition.[125] Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input. Such input is usually ambiguous; a giant, fifty-meter-tall pedestrian far away may produce the same pixels as a nearby normal-sized pedestrian, requiring the AI to judge the relative likelihood and reasonableness of different interpretations, for example by using its \"object model\" to assess that fifty-meter pedestrians do not exist.[126]\\n\\nMotion and manipulation\\nMain article: Robotics\\nAI is heavily used in robotics.[127] Advanced robotic arms and other industrial robots, widely used in modern factories, can learn from experience how to move efficiently despite the presence of friction and gear slippage.[128] A modern mobile robot, when given a small, static, and visible environment, can easily determine its location and map its environment; however, dynamic environments, such as (in endoscopy) the interior of a patient\\'s breathing body, pose a greater challenge. Motion planning is the process of breaking down a movement task into \"primitives\" such as individual joint movements. Such movement often involves compliant motion, a process where movement requires maintaining physical contact with an object.[129][130][131] Moravec\\'s paradox generalizes that low-level sensorimotor skills that humans take for granted are, counterintuitively, difficult to program into a robot; the paradox is named after Hans Moravec, who stated in 1988 that \"it is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility\".[132][133] This is attributed to the fact that, unlike checkers, physical dexterity has been a direct target of natural selection for millions of years.[134]\\n\\nSocial intelligence\\nMain article: Affective computing\\n Kismet, a robot with rudimentary social skills[135]\\nMoravec\\'s paradox can be extended to many forms of social intelligence.[136][137] Distributed multi-agent coordination of autonomous vehicles remains a difficult problem.[138] Affective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems which recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human affects.[139][140][141] Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal affect analysis (see multimodal sentiment analysis), wherein AI classifies the affects displayed by a videotaped subject.[142]\\nIn the long run, social skills and an understanding of human emotion and game theory would be valuable to a social agent. The ability to predict the actions of others by understanding their motives and emotional states would allow an agent to make better decisions. Some computer systems mimic human emotion and expressions to appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human\\xe2\\x80\\x93computer interaction.[143] Similarly, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; this tends to give na\\xc3\\xafve users an unrealistic conception of how intelligent existing computer agents actually are.[144]\\n\\nGeneral intelligence\\nMain articles: Artificial general intelligence and AI-complete\\nHistorically, projects such as the Cyc knowledge base (1984\\xe2\\x80\\x93) and the massive Japanese Fifth Generation Computer Systems initiative (1982\\xe2\\x80\\x931992) attempted to cover the breadth of human cognition. These early projects failed to escape the limitations of non-quantitative symbolic logic models and, in retrospect, greatly underestimated the difficulty of cross-domain AI. Nowadays, most current AI researchers work instead on tractable \"narrow AI\" applications (such as medical diagnosis or automobile navigation).[145] Many researchers predict that such \"narrow AI\" work in different individual domains will eventually be incorporated into a machine with artificial general intelligence (AGI), combining most of the narrow skills mentioned in this article and at some point even exceeding human ability in most or all these areas.[20][146] Many advances have general, cross-domain significance. One high-profile example is that DeepMind in the 2010s developed a \"generalized artificial intelligence\" that could learn many diverse Atari games on its own, and later developed a variant of the system which succeeds at sequential learning.[147][148][149] Besides transfer learning,[150] hypothetical AGI breakthroughs could include the development of reflective architectures that can engage in decision-theoretic metareasoning, and figuring out how to \"slurp up\" a comprehensive knowledge base from the entire unstructured Web.[7] Some argue that some kind of (currently-undiscovered) conceptually straightforward, but mathematically difficult, \"Master Algorithm\" could lead to AGI.[151] Finally, a few \"emergent\" approaches look to simulating human intelligence extremely closely, and believe that anthropomorphic features like an artificial brain or simulated child development may someday reach a critical point where general intelligence emerges.[152][153]\\nMany of the problems in this article may also require general intelligence, if machines are to solve the problems as well as people do. For example, even specific straightforward tasks, like machine translation, require that a machine read and write in both languages (NLP), follow the author\\'s argument (reason), know what is being talked about (knowledge), and faithfully reproduce the author\\'s original intent (social intelligence). A problem like machine translation is considered \"AI-complete\", because all of these problems need to be solved simultaneously in order to reach human-level machine performance.\\n\\nApproaches\\nNo established unifying theory or paradigm guides AI research. Researchers disagree about many issues.[154] A few of the most long standing questions that have remained unanswered are these: should artificial intelligence simulate natural intelligence by studying psychology or neurobiology? Or is human biology as irrelevant to AI research as bird biology is to aeronautical engineering?[17]\\nCan intelligent behavior be described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic or optimization)? Or does it necessarily require solving a large number of unrelated problems?[18]\\n\\nCybernetics and brain simulation\\nMain articles: Cybernetics and Computational neuroscience\\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, a number of researchers explored the connection between neurobiology, information theory, and cybernetics. Some of them built machines that used electronic networks to exhibit rudimentary intelligence, such as W. Grey Walter\\'s turtles and the Johns Hopkins Beast. Many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the Teleological Society at Princeton University and the Ratio Club in England.[155] By 1960, this approach was largely abandoned, although elements of it would be revived in the 1980s.\\n\\nSymbolic\\nMain article: Symbolic AI\\nWhen access to digital computers became possible in the mid-1950s, AI research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation. The research was centered in three institutions: Carnegie Mellon University, Stanford and MIT, and as described below, each one developed its own style of research. John Haugeland named these symbolic approaches to AI \"good old fashioned AI\" or \"GOFAI\".[156] During the 1960s, symbolic approaches had achieved great success at simulating high-level \"thinking\" in small demonstration programs. Approaches based on cybernetics or artificial neural networks were abandoned or pushed into the background.[157]\\nResearchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field.\\n\\nCognitive simulation\\nEconomist Herbert Simon and Allen Newell studied human problem-solving skills and attempted to formalize them, and their work laid the foundations of the field of artificial intelligence, as well as cognitive science, operations research and management science. Their research team used the results of psychological experiments to develop programs that simulated the techniques that people used to solve problems. This tradition, centered at Carnegie Mellon University would eventually culminate in the development of the Soar architecture in the middle 1980s.[158][159]\\n\\nLogic-based\\nUnlike Simon and Newell, John McCarthy felt that machines did not need to simulate human thought, but should instead try to find the essence of abstract reasoning and problem-solving, regardless whether people used the same algorithms.[17] His laboratory at Stanford (SAIL) focused on using formal logic to solve a wide variety of problems, including knowledge representation, planning and learning.[160] Logic was also the focus of the work at the University of Edinburgh and elsewhere in Europe which led to the development of the programming language Prolog and the science of logic programming.[161]\\n\\nAnti-logic or scruffy\\nResearchers at MIT (such as Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert)[162] found that solving difficult problems in vision and natural language processing required ad-hoc solutions\\xe2\\x80\\x94they argued that no simple and general principle (like logic) would capture all the aspects of intelligent behavior. Roger Schank described their \"anti-logic\" approaches as \"scruffy\" (as opposed to the \"neat\" paradigms at CMU and Stanford).[18] Commonsense knowledge bases (such as Doug Lenat\\'s Cyc) are an example of \"scruffy\" AI, since they must be built by hand, one complicated concept at a time.[163]\\n\\nKnowledge-based\\nWhen computers with large memories became available around 1970, researchers from all three traditions began to build knowledge into AI applications.[164] This \"knowledge revolution\" led to the development and deployment of expert systems (introduced by Edward Feigenbaum), the first truly successful form of AI software.[42] A key component of the system architecture for all expert systems is the knowledge base, which stores facts and rules that illustrate AI.[165] The knowledge revolution was also driven by the realization that enormous amounts of knowledge would be required by many simple AI applications.\\n\\nSub-symbolic\\nBy the 1980s, progress in symbolic AI seemed to stall and many believed that symbolic systems would never be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and pattern recognition. A number of researchers began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches to specific AI problems.[19] Sub-symbolic methods manage to approach intelligence without specific representations of knowledge.\\n\\nEmbodied intelligence\\nThis includes embodied, situated, behavior-based, and nouvelle AI. Researchers from the related field of robotics, such as Rodney Brooks, rejected symbolic AI and focused on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to move and survive.[166] Their work revived the non-symbolic point of view of the early cybernetics researchers of the 1950s and reintroduced the use of control theory in AI. This coincided with the development of the embodied mind thesis in the related field of cognitive science: the idea that aspects of the body (such as movement, perception and visualization) are required for higher intelligence.\\nWithin developmental robotics, developmental learning approaches are elaborated upon to allow robots to accumulate repertoires of novel skills through autonomous self-exploration, social interaction with human teachers, and the use of guidance mechanisms (active learning, maturation, motor synergies, etc.).[167][168][169][170]\\n\\nComputational intelligence and soft computing\\nInterest in neural networks and \"connectionism\" was revived by David Rumelhart and others in the middle of the 1980s.[171] Artificial neural networks are an example of soft computing\\xe2\\x80\\x94they are solutions to problems which cannot be solved with complete logical certainty, and where an approximate solution is often sufficient. Other soft computing approaches to AI include fuzzy systems, Grey system theory, evolutionary computation and many statistical tools. The application of soft computing to AI is studied collectively by the emerging discipline of computational intelligence.[172]\\n\\nStatistical learning\\nMuch of traditional GOFAI got bogged down on ad hoc patches to symbolic computation that worked on their own toy models but failed to generalize to real-world results. However, around the 1990s, AI researchers adopted sophisticated mathematical tools, such as hidden Markov models (HMM), information theory, and normative Bayesian decision theory to compare or to unify competing architectures. The shared mathematical language permitted a high level of collaboration with more established fields (like mathematics, economics or operations research).[d] Compared with GOFAI, new \"statistical learning\" techniques such as HMM and neural networks were gaining higher levels of accuracy in many practical domains such as data mining, without necessarily acquiring a semantic understanding of the datasets. The increased successes with real-world data led to increasing emphasis on comparing different approaches against shared test data to see which approach performed best in a broader context than that provided by idiosyncratic toy models; AI research was becoming more scientific. Nowadays results of experiments are often rigorously measurable, and are sometimes (with difficulty) reproducible.[44][173] Different statistical learning techniques have different limitations; for example, basic HMM cannot model the infinite possible combinations of natural language.[174] Critics note that the shift from GOFAI to statistical learning is often also a shift away from explainable AI. In AGI research, some scholars caution against over-reliance on statistical learning, and argue that continuing research into GOFAI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence.[175][176]\\n\\nIntegrating the approaches\\nIntelligent agent paradigm\\nAn intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success. The simplest intelligent agents are programs that solve specific problems. More complicated agents include human beings and organizations of human beings (such as firms). The paradigm allows researchers to directly compare or even combine different approaches to isolated problems, by asking which agent is best at maximizing a given \"goal function\". An agent that solves a specific problem can use any approach that works\\xe2\\x80\\x94some agents are symbolic and logical, some are sub-symbolic artificial neural networks and others may use new approaches. The paradigm also gives researchers a common language to communicate with other fields\\xe2\\x80\\x94such as decision theory and economics\\xe2\\x80\\x94that also use concepts of abstract agents. Building a complete agent requires researchers to address realistic problems of integration; for example, because sensory systems give uncertain information about the environment, planning systems must be able to function in the presence of uncertainty. The intelligent agent paradigm became widely accepted during the 1990s.[177]\\nAgent architectures and cognitive architectures\\nResearchers have designed systems to build intelligent systems out of interacting intelligent agents in a multi-agent system.[178] A hierarchical control system provides a bridge between sub-symbolic AI at its lowest, reactive levels and traditional symbolic AI at its highest levels, where relaxed time constraints permit planning and world modeling.[179] Some cognitive architectures are custom-built to solve a narrow problem; others, such as Soar, are designed to mimic human cognition and to provide insight into general intelligence. Modern extensions of Soar are hybrid intelligent systems that include both symbolic and sub-symbolic components.[180][181][182]\\nTools\\nAI has developed many tools to solve the most difficult problems in computer science. A few of the most general of these methods are discussed below.\\n\\nSearch and optimization\\nMain articles: Search algorithm, Mathematical optimization, and Evolutionary computation\\nMany problems in AI can be solved theoretically by intelligently searching through many possible solutions:[183] Reasoning can be reduced to performing a search. For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from premises to conclusions, where each step is the application of an inference rule.[184] Planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis.[185] Robotics algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use local searches in configuration space.[128] Many learning algorithms use search algorithms based on optimization.\\nSimple exhaustive searches[186] are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers. The result is a search that is too slow or never completes. The solution, for many problems, is to use \"heuristics\" or \"rules of thumb\" that prioritize choices in favor of those more more likely to reach a goal and to do so in a shorter number of steps. In some search methodologies heuristics can also serve to entirely eliminate some choices unlikely to lead to a goal (called \"pruning the search tree\"). Heuristics supply the program with a \"best guess\" for the path on which the solution lies.[187] Heuristics limit the search for solutions into a smaller sample size.[129]\\nA very different kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s, based on the mathematical theory of optimization. For many problems, it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made. These algorithms can be visualized as blind hill climbing: we begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, until we reach the top. Other optimization algorithms are simulated annealing, beam search and random optimization.[188]\\n\\n A particle swarm seeking the global minimum\\nEvolutionary computation uses a form of optimization search. For example, they may begin with a population of organisms (the guesses) and then allow them to mutate and recombine, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation (refining the guesses). Classic evolutionary algorithms include genetic algorithms, gene expression programming, and genetic programming.[189] Alternatively, distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails).[190][191]\\n\\nLogic\\nMain articles: Logic programming and Automated reasoning\\nLogic[192] is used for knowledge representation and problem solving, but it can be applied to other problems as well. For example, the satplan algorithm uses logic for planning[193] and inductive logic programming is a method for learning.[194]\\nSeveral different forms of logic are used in AI research. Propositional logic[195] involves truth functions such as \"or\" and \"not\". First-order logic[196] adds quantifiers and predicates, and can express facts about objects, their properties, and their relations with each other. Fuzzy set theory assigns a \"degree of truth\" (between 0 and 1) to vague statements such as \"Alice is old\" (or rich, or tall, or hungry) that are too linguistically imprecise to be completely true or false. Fuzzy logic is successfully used in control systems to allow experts to contribute vague rules such as \"if you are close to the destination station and moving fast, increase the train\\'s brake pressure\"; these vague rules can then be numerically refined within the system. Fuzzy logic fails to scale well in knowledge bases; many AI researchers question the validity of chaining fuzzy-logic inferences.[e][198][199]\\nDefault logics, non-monotonic logics and circumscription[103] are forms of logic designed to help with default reasoning and the qualification problem. Several extensions of logic have been designed to handle specific domains of knowledge, such as: description logics;[91] situation calculus, event calculus and fluent calculus (for representing events and time);[92] causal calculus;[93] belief calculus (belief revision);[200] and modal logics.[94] Logics to model contradictory or inconsistent statements arising in multi-agent systems have also been designed, such as paraconsistent logics.\\n\\nProbabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning\\nMain articles: Bayesian network, Hidden Markov model, Kalman filter, Particle filter, Decision theory, and Utility theory\\n Expectation-maximization clustering of Old Faithful eruption data starts from a random guess but then successfully converges on an accurate clustering of the two physically distinct modes of eruption.\\nMany problems in AI (in reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of powerful tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics.[201]\\nBayesian networks[202] are a very general tool that can be used for various problems: reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm),[203] learning (using the expectation-maximization algorithm),[f][205] planning (using decision networks)[206] and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks).[207] Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data, helping perception systems to analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters).[207] Compared with symbolic logic, formal Bayesian inference is computationally expensive. For inference to be tractable, most observations must be conditionally independent of one another. Complicated graphs with diamonds or other \"loops\" (undirected cycles) can require a sophisticated method such as Markov chain Monte Carlo, which spreads an ensemble of random walkers throughout the Bayesian network and attempts to converge to an assessment of the conditional probabilities. Bayesian networks are used on Xbox Live to rate and match players; wins and losses are \"evidence\" of how good a player is[citation needed]. AdSense uses a Bayesian network with over 300 million edges to learn which ads to serve.[208]\\nA key concept from the science of economics is \"utility\": a measure of how valuable something is to an intelligent agent. Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory, decision analysis,[209] and information value theory.[109] These tools include models such as Markov decision processes,[210] dynamic decision networks,[207] game theory and mechanism design.[211]\\n\\nClassifiers and statistical learning methods\\nMain articles: Classifier (mathematics), Statistical classification, and Machine learning\\nThe simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (\"if shiny then diamond\") and controllers (\"if shiny then pick up\"). Controllers do, however, also classify conditions before inferring actions, and therefore classification forms a central part of many AI systems. Classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine a closest match. They can be tuned according to examples, making them very attractive for use in AI. These examples are known as observations or patterns. In supervised learning, each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class. A class is a decision that has to be made. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.[212]\\nA classifier can be trained in various ways; there are many statistical and machine learning approaches. The decision tree[213] is perhaps the most widely used machine learning algorithm.[214] Other widely used classifiers are the neural network,[215]\\nk-nearest neighbor algorithm,[g][217]\\nkernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM),[h][219]\\nGaussian mixture model,[220] and the extremely popular naive Bayes classifier.[i][222] Classifier performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified, such as the dataset size, distribution of samples across classes, the dimensionality, and the level of noise. Model-based classifiers perform well if the assumed model is an extremely good fit for the actual data. Otherwise, if no matching model is available, and if accuracy (rather than speed or scalability) is the sole concern, conventional wisdom is that discriminative classifiers (especially SVM) tend to be more accurate than model-based classifiers such as \"naive Bayes\" on most practical data sets.[223][224]\\n\\nArtificial neural networks\\nMain articles: Artificial neural network and Connectionism\\n A neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain.\\nNeural networks were inspired by the architecture of neurons in the human brain. A simple \"neuron\" N accepts input from other neurons, each of which, when activated (or \"fired\"), casts a weighted \"vote\" for or against whether neuron N should itself activate. Learning requires an algorithm to adjust these weights based on the training data; one simple algorithm (dubbed \"fire together, wire together\") is to increase the weight between two connected neurons when the activation of one triggers the successful activation of another. The neural network forms \"concepts\" that are distributed among a subnetwork of shared[j] neurons that tend to fire together; a concept meaning \"leg\" might be coupled with a subnetwork meaning \"foot\" that includes the sound for \"foot\". Neurons have a continuous spectrum of activation; in addition, neurons can process inputs in a nonlinear way rather than weighing straightforward votes. Modern neural networks can learn both continuous functions and, surprisingly, digital logical operations. Neural networks\\' early successes included predicting the stock market and (in 1995) a mostly self-driving car.[k][225] In the 2010s, advances in neural networks using deep learning thrust AI into widespread public consciousness and contributed to an enormous upshift in corporate AI spending; for example, AI-related M&A in 2017 was over 25 times as large as in 2015.[226][227]\\nThe study of non-learning artificial neural networks[215] began in the decade before the field of AI research was founded, in the work of Walter Pitts and Warren McCullouch. Frank Rosenblatt invented the perceptron, a learning network with a single layer, similar to the old concept of linear regression. Early pioneers also include Alexey Grigorevich Ivakhnenko, Teuvo Kohonen, Stephen Grossberg, Kunihiko Fukushima, Christoph von der Malsburg, David Willshaw, Shun-Ichi Amari, Bernard Widrow, John Hopfield, Eduardo R. Caianiello, and others[citation needed].\\nThe main categories of networks are acyclic or feedforward neural networks (where the signal passes in only one direction) and recurrent neural networks (which allow feedback and short-term memories of previous input events). Among the most popular feedforward networks are perceptrons, multi-layer perceptrons and radial basis networks.[228] Neural networks can be applied to the problem of intelligent control (for robotics) or learning, using such techniques as Hebbian learning (\"fire together, wire together\"), GMDH or competitive learning.[229]\\nToday, neural networks are often trained by the backpropagation algorithm, which has been around since 1970 as the reverse mode of automatic differentiation published by Seppo Linnainmaa,[230][231] and was introduced to neural networks by Paul Werbos.[232][233][234]\\nHierarchical temporal memory is an approach that models some of the structural and algorithmic properties of the neocortex.[235]\\nTo summarize, most neural networks use some form of gradient descent on a hand-created neural topology. However, some research groups, such as Uber, argue that simple neuroevolution to mutate new neural network topologies and weights may be competitive with sophisticated gradient descent approaches[citation needed]. One advantage of neuroevolution is that it may be less prone to get caught in \"dead ends\".[236]\\n\\nDeep feedforward neural networks\\nMain article: Deep learning\\nDeep learning is the use of artificial neural networks which have several layers of neurons between the network\\'s inputs and outputs. Deep learning has transformed many important subfields of artificial intelligence[why?], including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing and others.[237][238][239]\\nAccording to one overview,[240] the expression \"Deep Learning\" was introduced to the machine learning community by Rina Dechter in 1986[241] and gained traction after\\nIgor Aizenberg and colleagues introduced it to artificial neural networks in 2000.[242] The first functional Deep Learning networks were published by Alexey Grigorevich Ivakhnenko and V. G. Lapa in 1965.[243][page\\xc2\\xa0needed] These networks are trained one layer at a time. Ivakhnenko\\'s 1971 paper[244] describes the learning of a deep feedforward multilayer perceptron with eight layers, already much deeper than many later networks. In 2006, a publication by Geoffrey Hinton and Ruslan Salakhutdinov introduced another way of pre-training many-layered feedforward neural networks (FNNs) one layer at a time, treating each layer in turn as an unsupervised restricted Boltzmann machine, then using supervised backpropagation for fine-tuning.[245] Similar to shallow artificial neural networks, deep neural networks can model complex non-linear relationships.\\nDeep learning often uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs), whose origins can be traced back to the Neocognitron introduced by Kunihiko Fukushima in 1980.[246] In 1989, Yann LeCun and colleagues applied backpropagation to such an architecture. In the early 2000s, in an industrial application, CNNs already processed an estimated 10% to 20% of all the checks written in the US.[247]\\nSince 2011, fast implementations of CNNs on GPUs have\\nwon many visual pattern recognition competitions.[239]\\nCNNs with 12 convolutional layers were used with reinforcement learning by Deepmind\\'s \"AlphaGo Lee\", the program that beat a top Go champion in 2016.[248]\\n\\nDeep recurrent neural networks\\nMain article: Recurrent neural networks\\nEarly on, deep learning was also applied to sequence learning with recurrent neural networks (RNNs)[249] which are theoretically Turing complete[250] and can run arbitrary programs to process arbitrary sequences of inputs. The depth of an RNN is unlimited and depends on the length of its input sequence; thus, an RNN is an example of deep learning.[239] RNNs can be trained by gradient descent[251][252][253] but suffer from the vanishing gradient problem.[237][254] In 1992, it was shown that unsupervised pre-training of a stack of recurrent neural networks can speed up subsequent supervised learning of deep sequential problems.[255]\\nNumerous researchers now use variants of a deep learning recurrent NN called the long short-term memory (LSTM) network published by Hochreiter & Schmidhuber in 1997.[256] LSTM is often trained by Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC).[257] At Google, Microsoft and Baidu this approach has revolutionized speech recognition.[258][259][260] For example, in 2015, Google\\'s speech recognition experienced a dramatic performance jump of 49% through CTC-trained LSTM, which is now available through Google Voice to billions of smartphone users.[261] Google also used LSTM to improve machine translation,[262] Language Modeling[263] and Multilingual Language Processing.[264] LSTM combined with CNNs also improved automatic image captioning[265] and a plethora of other applications.\\n\\nEvaluating progress\\nFurther information: Progress in artificial intelligence and Competitions and prizes in artificial intelligence\\nAI, like electricity or the steam engine, is a general purpose technology. There is no consensus on how to characterize which tasks AI tends to excel at.[266] While projects such as AlphaZero have succeeded in generating their own knowledge from scratch, many other machine learning projects require large training datasets.[267][268] Researcher Andrew Ng has suggested, as a \"highly imperfect rule of thumb\", that \"almost anything a typical human can do with less than one second of mental thought, we can probably now or in the near future automate using AI.\"[269] Moravec\\'s paradox suggests that AI lags humans at many tasks that the human brain has specifically evolved to perform well.[134]\\nGames provide a well-publicized benchmark for assessing rates of progress. AlphaGo around 2016 brought the era of classical board-game benchmarks to a close. Games of imperfect knowledge provide new challenges to AI in game theory.[270][271] E-sports such as StarCraft continue to provide additional public benchmarks.[272][273] Many competitions and prizes, such as the Imagenet Challenge, promote research in artificial intelligence. The most common areas of competition include general machine intelligence, conversational behavior, data-mining, robotic cars, and robot soccer as well as conventional games.[274]\\nThe \"imitation game\" (an interpretation of the 1950 Turing test that assesses whether a computer can imitate a human) is nowadays considered too exploitable to be a meaningful benchmark.[275] A derivative of the Turing test is the Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA). As the name implies, this helps to determine that a user is an actual person and not a computer posing as a human. Unlike the standard Turing test, CAPTCHA is administered by a machine and targeted to a human as opposed to being administered by a human and targeted to a machine. A computer asks a user to complete a simple test then generates a grade for that test. Computers are unable to solve the problem, so correct solutions are deemed to be the result of a person taking the test. A common type of CAPTCHA is the test that requires the typing of distorted letters, numbers or symbols that appear in an image undecipherable by a computer.[276]\\nProposed \"universal intelligence\" tests aim to compare how well machines, humans, and even non-human animals perform on problem sets that are generic as possible. At an extreme, the test suite can contain every possible problem, weighted by Kolmogorov complexity; unfortunately, these problem sets tend to be dominated by impoverished pattern-matching exercises where a tuned AI can easily exceed human performance levels.[277][278]\\n\\nHardware improvements\\nSince the 2010s, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks that contain many layers of non-linear hidden units and a very large output layer.[279] By 2019, graphic processing units (GPUs), often with AI-specific enhancements, had displaced CPUs as the dominant method of training large-scale commercial cloud AI.[280] OpenAI estimated the hardware compute used in the largest deep learning projects from AlexNet (2012) to AlphaZero (2017), and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of compute required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3.4 months.[281][282]\\n\\nApplications\\n An automated online assistant providing customer service on a web page \\xe2\\x80\\x93 one of many very primitive applications of artificial intelligence\\nMain article: Applications of artificial intelligence\\nAI is relevant to any intellectual task.[283] Modern artificial intelligence techniques are pervasive[284] and are too numerous to list here. Frequently, when a technique reaches mainstream use, it is no longer considered artificial intelligence; this phenomenon is described as the AI effect.[285]\\nHigh-profile examples of AI include autonomous vehicles (such as drones and self-driving cars), medical diagnosis, creating art (such as poetry), proving mathematical theorems, playing games (such as Chess or Go), search engines (such as Google search), online assistants (such as Siri), image recognition in photographs, spam filtering, predicting flight delays,[286] prediction of judicial decisions,[287] targeting online advertisements, [283][288][289] and energy storage[290]\\nWith social media sites overtaking TV as a source for news for young people and news organizations increasingly reliant on social media platforms for generating distribution,[291] major publishers now use artificial intelligence (AI) technology to post stories more effectively and generate higher volumes of traffic.[292]\\nAI can also produce Deepfakes, a content-altering technology. ZDNet reports, \"It presents something that did not actually occur,\" Though 88% of Americans believe Deepfakes can cause more harm than good, only 47% of them believe they can be targeted. The boom of election year also opens public discourse to threats of videos of falsified politician media.[293]\\n\\nHealthcare\\nMain article: Artificial intelligence in healthcare\\n A patient-side surgical arm of Da Vinci Surgical SystemAI in healthcare is often used for classification, whether to automate initial evaluation of a CT scan or EKG or to identify high-risk patients for population health. The breadth of applications is rapidly increasing.\\nAs an example, AI is being applied to the high-cost problem of dosage issues\\xe2\\x80\\x94where findings suggested that AI could save $16 billion. In 2016, a groundbreaking study in California found that a mathematical formula developed with the help of AI correctly determined the accurate dose of immunosuppressant drugs to give to organ patients.[294]  X-ray of a hand, with automatic calculation of bone age by computer software\\nArtificial intelligence is assisting doctors. According to Bloomberg Technology, Microsoft has developed AI to help doctors find the right treatments for cancer.[295] There is a great amount of research and drugs developed relating to cancer. In detail, there are more than 800 medicines and vaccines to treat cancer. This negatively affects the doctors, because there are too many options to choose from, making it more difficult to choose the right drugs for the patients. Microsoft is working on a project to develop a machine called \"Hanover\"[citation needed]. Its goal is to memorize all the papers necessary to cancer and help predict which combinations of drugs will be most effective for each patient. One project that is being worked on at the moment is fighting myeloid leukemia, a fatal cancer where the treatment has not improved in decades. Another study was reported to have found that artificial intelligence was as good as trained doctors in identifying skin cancers.[296] Another study is using artificial intelligence to try to monitor multiple high-risk patients, and this is done by asking each patient numerous questions based on data acquired from live doctor to patient interactions.[297] One study was done with transfer learning, the machine performed a diagnosis similarly to a well-trained ophthalmologist, and could generate a decision within 30 seconds on whether or not the patient should be referred for treatment, with more than 95% accuracy.[298]\\nAccording to CNN, a recent study by surgeons at the Children\\'s National Medical Center in Washington successfully demonstrated surgery with an autonomous robot. The team supervised the robot while it performed soft-tissue surgery, stitching together a pig\\'s bowel during open surgery, and doing so better than a human surgeon, the team claimed.[299] IBM has created its own artificial intelligence computer, the IBM Watson, which has beaten human intelligence (at some levels). Watson has struggled to achieve success and adoption in healthcare.[300]\\n\\nAutomotive\\nMain article: driverless cars\\nAdvancements in AI have contributed to the growth of the automotive industry through the creation and evolution of self-driving vehicles. As of 2016[update], there are over 30 companies utilizing AI into the creation of self-driving cars. A few companies involved with AI include Tesla, Google, and Apple.[301]\\nMany components contribute to the functioning of self-driving cars. These vehicles incorporate systems such as braking, lane changing, collision prevention, navigation and mapping. Together, these systems, as well as high-performance computers, are integrated into one complex vehicle.[302]\\nRecent developments in autonomous automobiles have made the innovation of self-driving trucks possible, though they are still in the testing phase. The UK government has passed legislation to begin testing of self-driving truck platoons in 2018.[303] Self-driving truck platoons are a fleet of self-driving trucks following the lead of one non-self-driving truck, so the truck platoons aren\\'t entirely autonomous yet. Meanwhile, the Daimler, a German automobile corporation, is testing the Freightliner Inspiration which is a semi-autonomous truck that will only be used on the highway.[304]\\nOne main factor that influences the ability for a driverless automobile to function is mapping. In general, the vehicle would be pre-programmed with a map of the area being driven. This map would include data on the approximations of street light and curb heights in order for the vehicle to be aware of its surroundings. However, Google has been working on an algorithm with the purpose of eliminating the need for pre-programmed maps and instead, creating a device that would be able to adjust to a variety of new surroundings.[305] Some self-driving cars are not equipped with steering wheels or brake pedals, so there has also been research focused on creating an algorithm that is capable of maintaining a safe environment for the passengers in the vehicle through awareness of speed and driving conditions.[306]\\nAnother factor that is influencing the ability of a driverless automobile is the safety of the passenger. To make a driverless automobile, engineers must program it to handle high-risk situations. These situations could include a head-on collision with pedestrians. The car\\'s main goal should be to make a decision that would avoid hitting the pedestrians and saving the passengers in the car. But there is a possibility the car would need to make a decision that would put someone in danger. In other words, the car would need to decide to save the pedestrians or the passengers.[307] The programming of the car in these situations is crucial to a successful driverless automobile.\\n\\nFinance and economics\\nFinancial institutions have long used artificial neural network systems to detect charges or claims outside of the norm, flagging these for human investigation. The use of AI in banking can be traced back to 1987 when Security Pacific National Bank in the US set-up a Fraud Prevention Task force to counter the unauthorized use of debit cards.[308] Programs like Kasisto and Moneystream are using AI in financial services.\\nBanks use artificial intelligence systems today to organize operations, maintain book-keeping, invest in stocks, and manage properties. AI can react to changes overnight or when business is not taking place.[309] In August 2001, robots beat humans in a simulated financial trading competition.[310] AI has also reduced fraud and financial crimes by monitoring behavioral patterns of users for any abnormal changes or anomalies.[311][312][313]\\nAI is increasingly being used by corporations. Jack Ma has controversially predicted that AI CEO\\'s are 30 years away.[314][315]\\nThe use of AI machines in the market in applications such as online trading and decision making has changed major economic theories.[316] For example, AI-based buying and selling platforms have changed the law of supply and demand in that it is now possible to easily estimate individualized demand and supply curves and thus individualized pricing. Furthermore, AI machines reduce information asymmetry in the market and thus making markets more efficient while reducing the volume of trades[citation needed]. Furthermore, AI in the markets limits the consequences of behavior in the markets again making markets more efficient[citation needed]. Other theories where AI has had impact include in rational choice, rational expectations, game theory, Lewis turning point, portfolio optimization and counterfactual thinking[citation needed].. In August 2019, the AICPA introduced an AI training course for accounting professionals.[317]\\n\\nCybersecurity\\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

Artificial intelligence and Natural Language Processing (NLP) has begun to be used by security companies - for example, SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solutions.  The more advanced of these solutions use AI and NLP to automatically sort the data in networks into high risk and low-risk information.  This enables security teams to focus on the attacks that have the potential to do real harm to the organization, and not become victims of attacks such as Denial of Service (DoS), Malware and others.\\n\\nGovernment\\nMain article: Artificial intelligence in government\\nArtificial intelligence in government consists of applications and regulation. Artificial intelligence paired with facial recognition systems may be used for mass surveillance. This is already the case in some parts of China.[318][319] Artificial intelligence has also competed in the Tama City mayoral elections in 2018.\\nIn 2019, the tech city of Bengaluru in India is set to deploy AI managed traffic signal systems across the 387 traffic signals in the city. This system will involve use of cameras to ascertain traffic density and accordingly calculate the time needed to clear the traffic volume which will determine the signal duration for vehicular traffic across streets.[320]\\n\\nLaw-related professions\\nMain article: Legal informatics \\xc2\\xa7\\xc2\\xa0Artificial intelligence\\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is becoming a mainstay component of law-related professions. In some circumstances, this analytics-crunching technology is using algorithms and machine learning to do work that was previously done by entry-level lawyers.[citation needed]\\nIn Electronic Discovery (eDiscovery), the industry has been focused on machine learning (predictive coding/technology assisted review), which is a subset of AI. To add to the soup of applications, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) are also in vogue in the industry.[321]\\n\\nVideo games\\nMain article: Artificial intelligence (video games)\\nIn video games, artificial intelligence is routinely used to generate dynamic purposeful behavior in non-player characters (NPCs). In addition, well-understood AI techniques are routinely used for pathfinding. Some researchers consider NPC AI in games to be a \"solved problem\" for most production tasks. Games with more atypical AI include the AI director of Left 4 Dead (2008) and the neuroevolutionary training of platoons in Supreme Commander 2 (2010).[322][323]\\n\\nMilitary\\nFurther information: Artificial intelligence arms race, Lethal autonomous weapon, and Unmanned combat aerial vehicle\\nThe United States and other nations are developing AI applications for a range of military functions.[324] The main military applications of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are to enhance C2, Communications, Sensors, Integration and Interoperability.[325] AI research is underway in the fields of intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, command and control, and in a variety of semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles.[324] Artificial Intelligence technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors, threat detection and identification, marking of enemy positions, target acquisition, coordination and deconfliction of distributed Join Fires between networked combat vehicles and tanks also inside Manned and Unmanned Teams (MUM-T).[325] AI has been incorporated into military operations in Iraq and Syria.[324]\\nWorldwide annual military spending on robotics rose from US$5.1 billion in 2010 to US$7.5 billion in 2015.[326][327] Military drones capable of autonomous action are widely considered a useful asset.[328] Many artificial intelligence researchers seek to distance themselves from military applications of AI.[329]\\n\\nHospitality\\nIn the hospitality industry, Artificial Intelligence based solutions are used to reduce staff load and increase efficiency[330] by cutting repetitive tasks frequency, trends analysis, guest interaction, and customer needs prediction.[331] Hotel services backed by Artificial Intelligence are represented in the form of a chatbot,[332] application, virtual voice assistant and service robots.\\n\\nAudit\\nFor financial statements audit, AI makes continuous audit possible. AI tools could analyze many sets of different information immediately. The potential benefit would be the overall audit risk will be reduced, the level of assurance will be increased and the time duration of audit will be reduced.[333]\\n\\nAdvertising\\nIt is possible to use AI to predict or generalize the behavior of customers from their digital footprints in order to target them with personalized promotions or build customer personas automatically.[334] A documented case reports that online gambling companies were using AI to improve customer targeting.[335]\\nMoreover, the application of Personality computing AI models can help reduce the cost of advertising campaigns by adding psychological targeting to more traditional sociodemographic or behavioral targeting.[336]\\n\\nArt\\nFurther information: Computer art\\nArtificial Intelligence has inspired numerous creative applications including its usage to produce visual art. The exhibition \"Thinking Machines: Art and Design in the Computer Age, 1959\\xe2\\x80\\x931989\" at MoMA[337] provides a good overview of the historical applications of AI for art, architecture, and design. Recent exhibitions showcasing the usage of AI to produce art include the Google-sponsored benefit and auction at the Gray Area Foundation in San Francisco, where artists experimented with the DeepDream algorithm[338] and the exhibition \"Unhuman: Art in the Age of AI,\" which took place in Los Angeles and Frankfurt in the fall of 2017.[339][340] In the spring of 2018, the Association of Computing Machinery dedicated a special magazine issue to the subject of computers and art highlighting the role of machine learning in the arts.[341] The Austrian Ars Electronica and Museum of Applied Arts, Vienna opened exhibitions on AI in 2019.[342][343] The Ars Electronica\\'s 2019 festival \"Out of the box\" extensively thematized the role of arts for a sustainable societal transformation with AI.[344]\\n\\nPhilosophy and ethics\\nMain articles: Philosophy of artificial intelligence and Ethics of artificial intelligence\\nThere are three philosophical questions related to AI[citation needed]:\\n\\nWhether artificial general intelligence is possible; whether a machine can solve any problem that a human being can solve using intelligence, or if there are hard limits to what a machine can accomplish.\\nWhether intelligent machines are dangerous; how humans can ensure that machines behave ethically and that they are used ethically.\\nWhether a machine can have a mind, consciousness and mental states in the same sense that human beings do; if a machine can be sentient, and thus deserve certain rights \\xe2\\x88\\x92 and if a machine can intentionally cause harm.\\nThe limits of artificial general intelligence\\nMain articles: Philosophy of artificial intelligence, Turing test, Physical symbol systems hypothesis, Dreyfus\\' critique of artificial intelligence, The Emperor\\'s New Mind, and AI effect\\nAlan Turing\\'s \"polite convention\"\\nOne need not decide if a machine can \"think\"; one need only decide if a machine can act as intelligently as a human being. This approach to the philosophical problems associated with artificial intelligence forms the basis of the Turing test.[345]\\nThe Dartmouth proposal\\n\"Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.\" This conjecture was printed in the proposal for the Dartmouth Conference of 1956.[346]\\nNewell and Simon\\'s physical symbol system hypothesis\\n\"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.\" Newell and Simon argue that intelligence consists of formal operations on symbols.[347] Hubert Dreyfus argues that, on the contrary, human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a \"feel\" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge. (See Dreyfus\\' critique of AI.)[348][349]\\nG\\xc3\\xb6delian arguments\\nG\\xc3\\xb6del himself,[350] John Lucas (in 1961) and Roger Penrose (in a more detailed argument from 1989 onwards) made highly technical arguments that human mathematicians can consistently see the truth of their own \"G\\xc3\\xb6del statements\" and therefore have computational abilities beyond that of mechanical Turing machines.[351] However, some people do not agree with the \"G\\xc3\\xb6delian arguments\".[352][353][354]\\nThe artificial brain argument\\nAn argument asserting that the brain can be simulated by machines and, because brains exhibit intelligence, these simulated brains must also exhibit intelligence \\xe2\\x88\\x92 ergo, machines can be intelligent. Hans Moravec, Ray Kurzweil and others have argued that it is technologically feasible to copy the brain directly into hardware and software, and that such a simulation will be essentially identical to the original.[152]\\nThe AI effect\\nA hypothesis claiming that machines are already intelligent, but observers have failed to recognize it. For example, when Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov in chess, the machine could be described as exhibiting intelligence. However, onlookers commonly discount the behavior of an artificial intelligence program by arguing that it is not \"real\" intelligence, with \"real\" intelligence being in effect defined as whatever behavior machines cannot do.\\nPotential harm\\nWidespread use of artificial intelligence could have unintended consequences that are dangerous or undesirable. Scientists from the Future of Life Institute, among others, described some short-term research goals to see how AI influences the economy, the laws and ethics that are involved with AI and how to minimize AI security risks. In the long-term, the scientists have proposed to continue optimizing function while minimizing possible security risks that come along with new technologies.[355]\\nThe potential negative effects of AI and automation were a major issue for Andrew Yang\\'s 2020 presidential campaign in the United States.[356] Irakli Beridze, Head of the Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics at UNICRI, United Nations, has expressed that \"I think the dangerous applications for AI, from my point of view, would be criminals or large terrorist organizations using it to disrupt large processes or simply do pure harm. [Terrorists could cause harm] via digital warfare, or it could be a combination of robotics, drones, with AI and other things as well that could be really dangerous. And, of course, other risks come from things like job losses. If we have massive numbers of people losing jobs and don\\'t find a solution, it will be extremely dangerous. Things like lethal autonomous weapons systems should be properly governed \\xe2\\x80\\x94 otherwise there\\'s massive potential of misuse.\"[357]\\n\\nExistential risk\\nMain article: Existential risk from artificial general intelligence\\nPhysicist Stephen Hawking, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, and SpaceX founder Elon Musk have expressed concerns about the possibility that AI could evolve to the point that humans could not control it, with Hawking theorizing that this could \"spell the end of the human race\".[358][359][360]\\n\\nThe development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race. Once humans develop artificial intelligence, it will take off on its own and redesign itself at an ever-increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn\\'t compete and would be superseded.\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x89Stephen Hawking[361]\\nIn his book Superintelligence, philosopher Nick Bostrom provides an argument that artificial intelligence will pose a threat to humankind. He argues that sufficiently intelligent AI, if it chooses actions based on achieving some goal, will exhibit convergent behavior such as acquiring resources or protecting itself from being shut down. If this AI\\'s goals do not fully reflect humanity\\'s\\xe2\\x80\\x94one example is an AI told to compute as many digits of pi as possible\\xe2\\x80\\x94it might harm humanity in order to acquire more resources or prevent itself from being shut down, ultimately to better achieve its goal.  Bostrom also emphasizes the difficulty of fully conveying humanity\\'s values to an advanced AI.  He uses the hypothetical example of giving an AI the goal to make humans smile to illustrate a misguided attempt.  If the AI in that scenario were to become superintelligent, Bostrom argues, it may resort to methods that most humans would find horrifying, such as inserting \"electrodes into the facial muscles of humans to cause constant, beaming grins\" because that would be an efficient way to achieve its goal of making humans smile.[362]  In his book Human Compatible, AI researcher Stuart J. Russell echoes some of Bostrom\\'s concerns while also proposing an approach to developing provably beneficial machines focused on uncertainty and deference to humans,[363]:173 possibly involving inverse reinforcement learning.[363]:191\\xe2\\x80\\x93193\\nConcern over risk from artificial intelligence has led to some high-profile donations and investments. A group of prominent tech titans including Peter Thiel, Amazon Web Services and Musk have committed $1 billion to OpenAI, a nonprofit company aimed at championing responsible AI development.[364] The opinion of experts within the field of artificial intelligence is mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superhumanly-capable AI.[365] Other technology industry leaders believe that artificial intelligence is helpful in its current form and will continue to assist humans. Oracle CEO Mark Hurd has stated that AI \"will actually create more jobs, not less jobs\" as humans will be needed to manage AI systems.[366] Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes AI will \"unlock a huge amount of positive things,\" such as curing disease and increasing the safety of autonomous cars.[367] In January 2015, Musk donated $10 million to the Future of Life Institute to fund research on understanding AI decision making. The goal of the institute is to \"grow wisdom with which we manage\" the growing power of technology. Musk also funds companies developing artificial intelligence such as DeepMind and Vicarious to \"just keep an eye on what\\'s going on with artificial intelligence.[368] I think there is potentially a dangerous outcome there.\"[369][370]\\nFor the danger of uncontrolled advanced AI to be realized, the hypothetical AI would have to overpower or out-think all of humanity, which a minority of experts argue is a possibility far enough in the future to not be worth researching.[371][372] Other counterarguments revolve around humans being either intrinsically or convergently valuable from the perspective of an artificial intelligence.[373]\\n\\nDevaluation of humanity\\nMain article: Computer Power and Human Reason\\nJoseph Weizenbaum wrote that AI applications cannot, by definition, successfully simulate genuine human empathy and that the use of AI technology in fields such as customer service or psychotherapy[374] was deeply misguided. Weizenbaum was also bothered that AI researchers (and some philosophers) were willing to view the human mind as nothing more than a computer program (a position now known as computationalism). To Weizenbaum these points suggest that AI research devalues human life.[375]\\n\\nSocial justice\\nFurther information: Algorithmic bias\\nSome are concerned that AI programs may unintentionally become biased after processing data that exhibits bias.[376]\\nAlgorithms already have numerous applications in legal systems. An example of this is COMPAS, a commercial program widely used by U.S. courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist. ProPublica claims that the average COMPAS-assigned recidivism risk level of black defendants is significantly higher than the average COMPAS-assigned risk level of white defendants.[377]\\n\\nDecrease in demand for human labor\\nFurther information: Technological unemployment \\xc2\\xa7\\xc2\\xa021st century\\nThe relationship between automation and employment is complicated. While automation eliminates old jobs, it also creates new jobs through micro-economic and macro-economic effects.[378] Unlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; The Economist states that \"the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution\" is \"worth taking seriously\".[379] Subjective estimates of the risk vary widely; for example, Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey estimate 47% of U.S. jobs are at \"high risk\" of potential automation, while an OECD report classifies only 9% of U.S. jobs as \"high risk\".[380][381][382] Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy.[383] Author Martin Ford and others go further and argue that many jobs are routine, repetitive and (to an AI) predictable; Ford warns that these jobs may be automated in the next couple of decades, and that many of the new jobs may not be \"accessible to people with average capability\", even with retraining. Economists point out that in the past technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but acknowledge that \"we\\'re in uncharted territory\" with AI.[25]\\n\\nAutonomous weapons\\nSee also: Lethal autonomous weapon\\nCurrently, 50+ countries are researching battlefield robots, including the United States, China, Russia, and the United Kingdom. Many people concerned about risk from superintelligent AI also want to limit the use of artificial soldiers and drones.[384]\\n\\nEthical machines\\nMachines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to prevent harm and minimize the risks; they may have the ability to use ethical reasoning to better choose their actions in the world. As such, there is a need for policy making to devise policies for and regulate artificial intelligence and robotics.[385] Research in this area includes machine ethics, artificial moral agents, friendly AI and discussion towards building a human rights framework is also in talks.[386]\\n\\nArtificial moral agents\\nWendell Wallach introduced the concept of artificial moral agents (AMA) in his book Moral Machines[387] For Wallach, AMAs have become a part of the research landscape of artificial intelligence as guided by its two central questions which he identifies as \"Does Humanity Want Computers Making Moral Decisions\"[388] and \"Can (Ro)bots Really Be Moral\".[389] For Wallach, the question is not centered on the issue of whether machines can demonstrate the equivalent of moral behavior, unlike the constraints which society may place on the development of AMAs.[390]\\n\\nMachine ethics\\nMain article: Machine ethics\\nThe field of machine ethics is concerned with giving machines ethical principles, or a procedure for discovering a way to resolve the ethical dilemmas they might encounter, enabling them to function in an ethically responsible manner through their own ethical decision making.[391] The field was delineated in the AAAI Fall 2005 Symposium on Machine Ethics: \"Past research concerning the relationship between technology and ethics has largely focused on responsible and irresponsible use of technology by human beings, with a few people being interested in how human beings ought to treat machines. In all cases, only human beings have engaged in ethical reasoning. The time has come for adding an ethical dimension to at least some machines. Recognition of the ethical ramifications of behavior involving machines, as well as recent and potential developments in machine autonomy, necessitate this. In contrast to computer hacking, software property issues, privacy issues and other topics normally ascribed to computer ethics, machine ethics is concerned with the behavior of machines towards human users and other machines. Research in machine ethics is key to alleviating concerns with autonomous systems\\xe2\\x80\\x94it could be argued that the notion of autonomous machines without such a dimension is at the root of all fear concerning machine intelligence. Further, investigation of machine ethics could enable the discovery of problems with current ethical theories, advancing our thinking about Ethics.\"[392] Machine ethics is sometimes referred to as machine morality, computational ethics or computational morality. A variety of perspectives of this nascent field can be found in the collected edition \"Machine Ethics\"[391] that stems from the AAAI Fall 2005 Symposium on Machine Ethics.[392]\\n\\nMalevolent and friendly AI\\nMain article: Friendly AI\\nPolitical scientist Charles T. Rubin believes that AI can be neither designed nor guaranteed to be benevolent.[393] He argues that \"any sufficiently advanced benevolence may be indistinguishable from malevolence.\" Humans should not assume machines or robots would treat us favorably because there is no a priori reason to believe that they would be sympathetic to our system of morality, which has evolved along with our particular biology (which AIs would not share). Hyper-intelligent software may not necessarily decide to support the continued existence of humanity and would be extremely difficult to stop. This topic has also recently begun to be discussed in academic publications as a real source of risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth.\\nOne proposal to deal with this is to ensure that the first generally intelligent AI is \\'Friendly AI\\' and will be able to control subsequently developed AIs. Some question whether this kind of check could actually remain in place.\\nLeading AI researcher Rodney Brooks writes, \"I think it is a mistake to be worrying about us developing malevolent AI anytime in the next few hundred years. I think the worry stems from a fundamental error in not distinguishing the difference between the very real recent advances in a particular aspect of AI and the enormity and complexity of building sentient volitional intelligence.\"[394]\\n\\nMachine consciousness, sentience and mind\\nMain article: Artificial consciousness\\nIf an AI system replicates all key aspects of human intelligence, will that system also be sentient\\xe2\\x80\\x94will it have a mind which has conscious experiences? This question is closely related to the philosophical problem as to the nature of human consciousness, generally referred to as the hard problem of consciousness.\\n\\nConsciousness\\nMain articles: Hard problem of consciousness and Theory of mind\\nDavid Chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the \"hard\" and \"easy\" problems of consciousness.[395] The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all. Human information processing is easy to explain, however human subjective experience is difficult to explain.\\nFor example, consider what happens when a person is shown a color swatch and identifies it, saying \"it\\'s red\". The easy problem only requires understanding the machinery in the brain that makes it possible for a person to know that the color swatch is red. The hard problem is that people also know something else\\xe2\\x80\\x94they also know what red looks like. (Consider that a person born blind can know that something is red without knowing what red looks like.)[l] Everyone knows subjective experience exists, because they do it every day (e.g., all sighted people know what red looks like). The hard problem is explaining how the brain creates it, why it exists, and how it is different from knowledge and other aspects of the brain.\\n\\nComputationalism and functionalism\\nMain articles: Computationalism and Functionalism (philosophy of mind)\\nComputationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind or the human brain (or both) is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing.[396] Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind-body problem. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam.\\n\\nStrong AI hypothesis\\nMain article: Chinese room\\nThe philosophical position that John Searle has named \"strong AI\" states: \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\"[397] Searle counters this assertion with his Chinese room argument, which asks us to look inside the computer and try to find where the \"mind\" might be.[398]\\n\\nRobot rights\\nMain article: Robot rights\\nIf a machine can be created that has intelligence, could it also feel? If it can feel, does it have the same rights as a human? This issue, now known as \"robot rights\", is currently being considered by, for example, California\\'s Institute for the Future, although many critics believe that the discussion is premature.[399] Some critics of transhumanism argue that any hypothetical robot rights would lie on a spectrum with animal rights and human rights. [400] The subject is profoundly discussed in the 2010 documentary film Plug & Pray,[401] and many sci fi media such as Star Trek Next Generation, with the character of Commander Data, who fought being disassembled for research, and wanted to \"become human\", and the robotic holograms in Voyager.\\n\\nSuperintelligence\\nMain article: Superintelligence\\nAre there limits to how intelligent machines\\xe2\\x80\\x94or human-machine hybrids\\xe2\\x80\\x94can be? A superintelligence, hyperintelligence, or superhuman intelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind. Superintelligence may also refer to the form or degree of intelligence possessed by such an agent.[146]\\n\\nTechnological singularity\\nMain articles: Technological singularity and Moore\\'s law\\nIf research into Strong AI produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself. The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to recursive self-improvement.[402] The new intelligence could thus increase exponentially and dramatically surpass humans. Science fiction writer Vernor Vinge named this scenario \"singularity\".[403] Technological singularity is when accelerating progress in technologies will cause a runaway effect wherein artificial intelligence will exceed human intellectual capacity and control, thus radically changing or even ending civilization. Because the capabilities of such an intelligence may be impossible to comprehend, the technological singularity is an occurrence beyond which events are unpredictable or even unfathomable.[403][146]\\nRay Kurzweil has used Moore\\'s law (which describes the relentless exponential improvement in digital technology) to calculate that desktop computers will have the same processing power as human brains by the year 2029, and predicts that the singularity will occur in 2045.[403]\\n\\nTranshumanism\\nMain article: Transhumanism\\nRobot designer Hans Moravec, cyberneticist Kevin Warwick and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either.[404] This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger.\\nEdward Fredkin argues that \"artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution\", an idea first proposed by Samuel Butler\\'s \"Darwin among the Machines\" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by George Dyson in his book of the same name in 1998.[405]\\n\\nEconomics\\nThe long-term economic effects of AI are uncertain. A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term unemployment, but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit, if productivity gains are redistributed.[406] A February 2020 European Union white paper on artificial intelligence advocated for artificial intelligence for economic benefits, including \"improving healthcare (e.g. making diagnosis more  precise,  enabling  better  prevention  of  diseases), increasing  the  efficiency  of  farming, contributing  to climate  change mitigation  and  adaptation, [and] improving  the  efficiency  of production systems through predictive maintenance\", while acknowledging potential risks.[284]\\n\\nRegulation\\nMain articles: Regulation of artificial intelligence and Regulation of algorithms\\nThe development of public sector policies for promoting and regulating artificial intelligence (AI) is considered necessary to both encourage AI and manage associated risks, but challenging.[407] In 2017 Elon Musk called for regulation of AI development.[408] Multiple states now have national policies under development or in place,[409] and in February 2020, the European Union published its draft strategy paper for promoting and regulating AI.[410]\\n\\nIn fiction\\nMain article: Artificial intelligence in fiction\\n The word \"robot\" itself was coined by Karel \\xc4\\x8capek in his 1921 play R.U.R., the title standing for \"Rossum\\'s Universal Robots\"\\nThought-capable artificial beings appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity,[27]\\nand have been a persistent theme in science fiction.\\nA common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley\\'s Frankenstein, where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. This includes such works as Arthur C. Clarke\\'s and Stanley Kubrick\\'s 2001: A Space Odyssey (both 1968), with HAL 9000, the murderous computer in charge of the Discovery One spaceship, as well as The Terminator (1984) and The Matrix (1999). In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and Bishop from Aliens (1986) are less prominent in popular culture.[411]\\nIsaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many books and stories, most notably the \"Multivac\" series about a super-intelligent computer of the same name. Asimov\\'s laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics;[412] while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov\\'s laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity.[413]\\nTranshumanism (the merging of humans and machines) is explored in the manga Ghost in the Shell and the science-fiction series Dune. In the 1980s, artist Hajime Sorayama\\'s Sexy Robots series were painted and published in Japan depicting the actual organic human form with lifelike muscular metallic skins and later \"the Gynoids\" book followed that was used by or influenced movie makers including George Lucas and other creatives. Sorayama never considered these organic robots to be real part of nature but always an unnatural product of the human mind, a fantasy existing in the mind even when realized in actual form.\\nSeveral works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel, and thus to suffer. This appears in Karel \\xc4\\x8capek\\'s R.U.R., the films A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina, as well as the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, by Philip K. Dick. Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence.[414]\\n\\nSee also\\n\\n\\nComputer programming portal\\n\\nAbductive reasoning\\nA.I.

Christof Koch doubts the possibility of \"intelligent\" machines attaining consciousness, because \"[e]ven the most sophisticated brain simulations are unlikely to produce conscious feelings.\" (p.\\xc2\\xa048.) According to Koch, \"Whether machines can become sentient [is important] for ethical reasons. If computers experience life through their own senses, they cease to be purely a means to an end determined by their usefulness to... humans. Per GNW [the Global Neuronal Workspace theory], they turn from mere objects into subjects... with a point of view.... Once computers\\' cognitive abilities rival those of humanity, their impulse to push for legal and political rights will become irresistible \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the right not to be deleted, not to have their memories wiped clean, not to suffer pain and degradation.

A stumbling block to AI has been an incapacity for reliable disambiguation.

Rules-based systems cannot deal with circumstances their programmers did not anticipate.  Learning systems are limited by the data on which they were trained.

Advanced autopilot features in cars, although they perform well in some circumstances, have driven cars without warning into trucks, concrete barriers, and parked cars.

The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal.\\n\\n\\n   Understanding Artificial Intelligence  \\n\\nWhen most people hear the term artificial intelligence, the first thing they usually think of is robots. That's because big-budget films and novels weave stories about human-like machines that wreak havoc on Earth. But nothing could be further from the truth.\\n\\n\\n\\nArtificial intelligence is based on the principle that human intelligence can be defined in a way that a machine can easily mimic it and execute tasks, from the most simple to those that are even more complex. The goals of artificial intelligence include learning, reasoning, and perception.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs technology advances, previous benchmarks that defined artificial intelligence become outdated. For example, machines that calculate basic functions or recognize text through optimal character recognition are no longer considered to embody artificial intelligence, since this function is now taken for granted as an inherent computer function.\\n\\n\\n\\nAI is continuously evolving to benefit many different industries. Machines are wired using a cross-disciplinary approach based in mathematics, computer science, linguistics, psychology,\\xc2\\xa0and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlgorithms often play a very important part in the structure of artificial intelligence, where simple algorithms are used in simple applications, while more complex ones help frame strong artificial intelligence.\\n\\n\\n   Applications of Artificial Intelligence  \\n\\nThe applications for artificial intelligence are endless. The technology can be applied to many different sectors and industries. AI is being tested and used in the healthcare industry for dosing drugs and different treatment in patients, and for surgical procedures in the operating room.\\n\\n\\n\\nOther examples of machines with artificial intelligence include computers that play chess and self-driving cars. Each of these machines must weigh the consequences of any action they take, as each action will impact the end result. In chess, the end result is winning the game. For self-driving cars, the computer system must account for all external data and compute it to act in a way that prevents a collision.\\n\\n\\n\\nArtificial intelligence also has applications in the financial industry, where it is used to detect and flag activity in banking and finance such as unusual debit card usage and large account deposits\\xe2\\x80\\x94all of which help a bank's fraud department. Applications for AI are also being used to help streamline and make trading easier. This is done by making supply, demand, and pricing of securities easier to estimate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKey Takeaways\\n\\nArtificial intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines.The goals of artificial intelligence include learning, reasoning,\\xc2\\xa0and perception.AI is being used across different industries including finance and healthcare.Weak AI tends to be simple and single-task oriented, while strong AI carries on tasks that are more complex and human-like.\\n\\n\\n   Categorization of Artificial Intelligence  \\n\\nArtificial intelligence can be divided into two different categories: weak and strong. Weak artificial intelligence embodies a system designed to carry out one particular job. Weak AI systems include video games such as the chess example from above and personal assistants such as Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri. You ask the assistant a question, it answers it for you.\\n\\n\\n\\nStrong artificial intelligence systems are systems that carry on the tasks considered to be human-like. These tend to be more complex and complicated systems. They are programmed to handle situations in which they may be required to problem solve without having a person intervene. These kinds of systems can be found in applications like self-driving cars or in hospital operating rooms.\\n\\n\\n   Special Considerations  \\n\\nSince its beginning, artificial intelligence has come under scrutiny from scientists and the public alike. One common theme is the idea that machines will become so highly developed that humans will not be able to keep up and they will take off on their own, redesigning themselves at an exponential rate.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnother is that machines can hack into people's privacy and even be weaponized.\\xc2\\xa0Other arguments debate the ethics of artificial intelligence and whether intelligent systems such as robots should be treated with the same rights as humans.\\n\\n\\n\\nSelf-driving cars have been fairly controversial as their machines tend to be designed for the lowest possible risk and the least casualties. If presented with a scenario of colliding with one person or another at the same time, these cars would calculate the option that would cause the least amount of damage.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnother contentious issue many people have with artificial intelligence is how it may affect human employment. With many industries looking to automate certain jobs through the use of intelligent machinery, there is a concern that people would be pushed out of the workforce. Self-driving cars may remove the need for taxis and car-share programs, while manufacturers may easily replace human labor with machines, making people's skills more obsolete.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCompare Accounts\\n\\n\\nAdvertiser Disclosure\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xc3\\x97\\n\\nThe offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProvider\\n\\nName\\n\\nDescription\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated Terms\\n\\n\\nWeak AI\\n\\nWeak AI is a machine intelligence that is limited to a particular area.\\nmore\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStrong AI\\n\\nStrong AI is a type of machine intelligence that is equivalent to human intelligence.\\nmore\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat Is Knowledge Engineering?\\n\\nKnowledge engineering is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables a system or machine to mimic the thought process of a human expert.\\nmore\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAI Winter Definition\\n\\nAI (Artificial Intelligence) winter is a time period in which funding for projects aimed at developing human-like intelligence in machines is minimal.\\nmore\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIntroduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP)\\n\\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) is a type of artificial intelligence that allows computers to break down and process human language.\\nmore\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nArtificial Neural Network (ANN)\\n\\nAn artificial neural network (ANN) is the foundation of artificial intelligence (AI), solving problems that would be nearly impossible by humans.\\nmore\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPartner Links\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated Articles\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContinuing Education\\n\\nHow AI is Shaping the Advisory Landscape\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlgorithmic/Automated Trading Basic Education\\n\\nUsing Genetic Algorithms to Forecast Financial Markets\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nETF Trading Strategy & Education\\n\\nTop ETFs Capitalizing on Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCareer Advice\\n\\n7 Jobs That (Probably) Won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t Be Automated\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAutomated Investing\\n\\nThe Best Technical Analysis Trading Software\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCompany Profiles\\n\\nTop 5 Companies Owned by Cisco\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout Us\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTerms of Use\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDictionary\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEditorial Policy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertise\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNews\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContact Us\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCareers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCalifornia Privacy Notice\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#\\n\\n\\nA\\n\\n\\nB\\n\\n\\nC\\n\\n\\nD\\n\\n\\nE\\n\\n\\nF\\n\\n\\nG\\n\\n\\nH\\n\\n\\nI\\n\\n\\nJ\\n\\n\\nK\\n\\n\\nL\\n\\n\\nM\\n\\n\\nN\\n\\n\\nO\\n\\n\\nP\\n\\n\\nQ\\n\\n\\nR\\n\\n\\nS\\n\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\nU\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\n\\nW\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\n\\nY\\n\\n\\nZ\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInvestopedia is part of the Dotdash publishing family.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

In the consumer market, IoT technology is most synonymous with products pertaining to the concept of the \"smart home\", including devices and appliances (such as lighting fixtures, thermostats, home security systems and cameras, and other home appliances) that support one or more common ecosystems, and can be controlled via devices associated with that ecosystem, such as smartphones and smart speakers.\\nThere are a number of serious concerns about dangers in the growth of IoT, especially in the areas of privacy and security, and consequently industry and governmental moves to address these concerns have begun.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 History\\n2 Applications\\n\\n2.1 Consumer applications\\n\\n2.1.1 Smart home\\n2.1.2 Elder care\\n\\n\\n2.2 Organisational applications\\n\\n2.2.1 Medical and healthcare\\n2.2.2 Transportation\\n2.2.3 V2X communications\\n2.2.4 Building and home automation\\n\\n\\n2.3 Industrial applications\\n\\n2.3.1 Manufacturing\\n2.3.2 Agriculture\\n\\n\\n2.4 Infrastructure applications\\n\\n2.4.1 Metropolitan scale deployments\\n2.4.2 Energy management\\n2.4.3 Environmental monitoring\\n\\n\\n2.5 Military applications\\n\\n2.5.1 Internet of Battlefield Things\\n2.5.2 Ocean of Things\\n\\n\\n2.6 Product digitisation\\n\\n\\n3 Trends and characteristics\\n\\n3.1 Intelligence\\n3.2 Architecture\\n\\n3.2.1 Network architecture\\n\\n\\n3.3 Complexity\\n3.4 Size considerations\\n3.5 Space considerations\\n3.6 A solution to \"basket of remotes\"\\n\\n\\n4 Enabling technologies for IoT\\n\\n4.1 Addressability\\n4.2 Application Layer\\n4.3 Short-range wireless\\n4.4 Medium-range wireless\\n4.5 Long-range wireless\\n4.6 Wired\\n4.7 Standards and standards organizations\\n\\n\\n5 Politics and civic engagement\\n6 Government regulation on IoT\\n7 Criticism, problems and controversies\\n\\n7.1 Platform fragmentation\\n7.2 Privacy, autonomy, and control\\n7.3 Data storage\\n7.4 Security\\n7.5 Safety\\n7.6 Design\\n7.7 Environmental sustainability impact\\n7.8 Intentional obsolescence of devices\\n7.9 Confusing terminology\\n\\n\\n8 IoT adoption barriers\\n\\n8.1 Lack of interoperability and unclear value propositions\\n8.2 Privacy and security concerns\\n8.3 Traditional governance structure\\n8.4 Business planning and models\\n\\n\\n9 See also\\n10 References\\n11 Bibliography\\n\\n\\nHistory[edit]\\nThe main concept of a network of smart devices was discussed as early as 1982, with a modified Coca-Cola vending machine at Carnegie Mellon University becoming the first Internet-connected appliance,[5] able to report its inventory and whether newly loaded drinks were cold or not.[6] Mark Weiser\\'s 1991 paper on ubiquitous computing, \"The Computer of the 21st Century\", as well as academic venues such as UbiComp and PerCom produced the contemporary vision of the IoT.[7][8] In 1994, Reza Raji described the concept in IEEE Spectrum as \"[moving] small packets of data to a large set of nodes, so as to integrate and automate everything from home appliances to entire factories\".[9] Between 1993 and 1997, several companies proposed solutions like Microsoft\\'s at Work or Novell\\'s NEST. The field gained momentum when Bill Joy envisioned device-to-device communication as a part of his \"Six Webs\" framework, presented at the World Economic Forum at Davos in 1999.[10]\\nThe term \"Internet of things\" was likely coined by Kevin Ashton of Procter & Gamble, later MIT\\'s Auto-ID Center, in 1999,[11] though he prefers the phrase \"Internet for things\".[12] At that point, he viewed radio-frequency identification (RFID) as essential to the Internet of things,[13] which would allow computers to manage all individual things.[14][15][16]\\nDefining the Internet of things as \"simply the point in time when more \\'things or objects\\' were connected to the Internet than people\", Cisco Systems estimated that the IoT was \"born\" between 2008 and 2009, with the things/people ratio growing from 0.08 in 2003 to 1.84 in 2010.[17]\\nThe key driving force behind the Internet of things is the MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor, or MOS transistor),[18] which was originally invented by Mohamed M. Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959.[19][20] The MOSFET is the basic building block of most modern electronics, including computers, smartphones, tablets and Internet services. MOSFET scaling miniaturization at a pace predicted by Dennard scaling and Moore\\'s law has been the driving force behind technological advances in the electronics industry since the late 20th century. MOSFET scaling has been extended into the early 21st century with advances such as reducing power consumption, silicon-on-insulator (SOI) semiconductor device fabrication, and multi-core processor technology, leading up to the Internet of things, which is being driven by MOSFETs scaling down to nanoelectronic levels with reducing energy consumption.[21]\\n\\nApplications[edit]\\n A Nest learning thermostat reporting on energy usage and local weather\\n A Ring doorbell connected to the Internet\\n An August Home smart lock connected to the Internet\\nThe extensive set of applications for IoT devices[22] is often divided into consumer, commercial, industrial, and infrastructure spaces.[23][24]\\n\\nConsumer applications[edit]\\nA growing portion of IoT devices are created for consumer use, including connected vehicles, home automation, wearable technology, connected health, and appliances with remote monitoring capabilities.[25]\\n\\nSmart home[edit]\\nIoT devices are a part of the larger concept of home automation, which can include lighting, heating and air conditioning, media and security systems.[26][27] Long-term benefits could include energy savings by automatically ensuring lights and electronics are turned off.\\nA smart home or automated home could be based on a platform or hubs that control smart devices and appliances.[28] For instance, using Apple\\'s HomeKit, manufacturers can have their home products and accessories controlled by an application in iOS devices such as the iPhone and the Apple Watch.[29][30] This could be a dedicated app or iOS native applications such as Siri.[31] This can be demonstrated in the case of Lenovo\\'s Smart Home Essentials, which is a line of smart home devices that are controlled through Apple\\'s Home app or Siri without the need for a Wi-Fi bridge.[31] There are also dedicated smart home hubs that are offered as standalone platforms to connect different smart home products and these include the Amazon Echo, Google Home, Apple\\'s HomePod, and Samsung\\'s SmartThings Hub.[32] In addition to the commercial systems, there are many non-proprietary, open source ecosystems; including Home Assistant, OpenHAB and Domoticz.[33][34]\\n\\nElder care[edit]\\nOne key application of a smart home is to provide assistance for those with disabilities and elderly individuals. These home systems use assistive technology to accommodate an owner\\'s specific disabilities.[35] Voice control can assist users with sight and mobility limitations while alert systems can be connected directly to cochlear implants worn by hearing-impaired users.[36] They can also be equipped with additional safety features. These features can include sensors that monitor for medical emergencies such as falls or seizures.[37] Smart home technology applied in this way can provide users with more freedom and a higher quality of life.[35]\\nThe term \"Enterprise IoT\" refers to devices used in business and corporate settings. By 2019, it is estimated that the EIoT will account for 9.1 billion devices.[23]\\n\\nOrganisational applications[edit]\\nMedical and healthcare[edit]\\nThe Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is an application of the IoT for medical and health related purposes, data collection and analysis for research, and monitoring.[38][39][40][41][42] The IoMT has been referenced as \"Smart Healthcare\",[43] as the technology for creating a digitized healthcare system, connecting available medical resources and healthcare services.[citation needed][44]\\nIoT devices can be used to enable remote health monitoring and emergency notification systems. These health monitoring devices can range from blood pressure and heart rate monitors to advanced devices capable of monitoring specialized implants, such as pacemakers, Fitbit electronic wristbands, or advanced hearing aids.[45] Some hospitals have begun implementing \"smart beds\" that can detect when they are occupied and when a patient is attempting to get up. It can also adjust itself to ensure appropriate pressure and support is applied to the patient without the manual interaction of nurses.[38] A 2015 Goldman Sachs report indicated that healthcare IoT devices \"can save the United States more than $300 billion in annual healthcare expenditures by increasing revenue and decreasing cost.\"[46] Moreover, the use of mobile devices to support medical follow-up led to the creation of \\'m-health\\', used analyzed health statistics.\"\\n[47]\\nSpecialized sensors can also be equipped within living spaces to monitor the health and general well-being of senior citizens, while also ensuring that proper treatment is being administered and assisting people regain lost mobility via therapy as well.[48] These sensors create a network of intelligent sensors that are able to collect, process, transfer, and analyze valuable information in different environments, such as connecting in-home monitoring devices to hospital-based systems.[43] Other consumer devices to encourage healthy living, such as connected scales or wearable heart monitors, are also a possibility with the IoT.[49] End-to-end health monitoring IoT platforms are also available for antenatal and chronic patients, helping one manage health vitals and recurring medication requirements.[50]\\nAdvances in plastic and fabric electronics fabrication methods have enabled ultra-low cost, use-and-throw\\xc2\\xa0IoMT sensors. These sensors, along with the required RFID electronics, can be fabricated on paper or e-textiles for wirelessly powered disposable sensing devices.[51] Applications have been established for point-of-care medical diagnostics, where portability and low system-complexity is essential.[52]\\nAs of 2018[update] IoMT was not only being applied in the clinical laboratory industry,[40] but also in the healthcare and health insurance industries. IoMT in the healthcare industry is now permitting doctors, patients, and others, such as guardians of patients, nurses, families, and similar, to be part of a system, where patient records are saved in a database, allowing doctors and the rest of the medical staff to have access to patient information.[53] Moreover, IoT-based systems are patient-centered, which involves being flexible to the patient\\'s medical conditions.[citation needed] IoMT in the insurance industry provides access to better and new types of dynamic information. This includes sensor-based solutions such as biosensors, wearables, connected health devices, and mobile apps to track customer behaviour. This can lead to more accurate underwriting and new pricing models.[54]\\nThe application of the IoT in healthcare plays a fundamental role in managing chronic diseases and in disease prevention and control. Remote monitoring is made possible through the connection of powerful wireless solutions. The connectivity enables health practitioners to capture patient\\'s data and applying complex algorithms in health data analysis.[55]\\n\\nTransportation[edit]\\n Digital variable speed-limit sign\\nThe IoT can assist in the integration of communications, control, and information processing across various transportation systems. Application of the IoT extends to all aspects of transportation systems (i.e. the vehicle,[56] the infrastructure, and the driver or user). Dynamic interaction between these components of a transport system enables inter- and intra-vehicular communication,[57] smart traffic control, smart parking, electronic toll collection systems, logistics and fleet management, vehicle control, safety, and road assistance.[45][58] In Logistics and Fleet Management, for example, an IoT platform can continuously monitor the location and conditions of cargo and assets via wireless sensors and send specific alerts when management exceptions occur (delays, damages, thefts, etc.). This can only be possible with IoT technology and its seamless connectivity among devices. Sensors such as GPS, Humidity, and Temperature send data to the IoT platform and then the data is analyzed and then sent to the users. This way, users can track the real-time status of vehicles and can make appropriate decisions. If combined with Machine Learning, then it also helps in reducing traffic accidents by introducing drowsiness alerts to drivers and providing self-driven cars too.\\n\\nV2X communications[edit]\\nMain article: V2X\\nIn vehicular communication systems, vehicle-to-everything communication (V2X), consists of three main components: vehicle to vehicle communication (V2V), vehicle to infrastructure communication (V2I) and vehicle to pedestrian communications (V2P). V2X is the first step to autonomous driving and connected road infrastructure.[citation needed]\\n\\nBuilding and home automation[edit]\\nIoT devices can be used to monitor and control the mechanical, electrical and electronic systems used in various types of buildings (e.g., public and private, industrial, institutions, or residential)[45] in home automation and building automation systems. In this context, three main areas are being covered in literature:[59]\\n\\nThe integration of the Internet with building energy management systems in order to create energy efficient and IOT-driven \"smart buildings\".[59]\\nThe possible means of real-time monitoring for reducing energy consumption[60] and monitoring occupant behaviors.[59]\\nThe integration of smart devices in the built environment and how they might to know how to be used in future applications.[59]\\nIndustrial applications[edit]\\nMain article: Industrial internet of things\\nAlso known as IIoT, industrial IoT devices acquire and analyze data from connected equipment, operational technology (OT), locations and people. Combined with operational technology (OT) monitoring devices, IIoT helps regulate and monitor industrial systems.Also, the same implementation can be carried out for automated record updates of asset placement in industrial storage units as the size of the assets can vary from a small screw till the whole motor spare part and misplacement of such assets can cause a percentile loss of manpower time and money.\\n\\nManufacturing[edit]\\nThe IoT can realize the seamless integration of various manufacturing devices equipped with sensing, identification, processing, communication, actuation, and networking capabilities. Based on such a highly integrated smart cyber-physical space, it opens the door to create whole new business and market opportunities for manufacturing.[61]\\nNetwork control and management of manufacturing equipment, asset and situation management, or manufacturing process control bring the IoT within the realm of industrial applications and smart manufacturing as well.[62] The IoT intelligent systems enable rapid manufacturing of new products, dynamic response to product demands, and real-time optimization of manufacturing production and supply chain networks, by networking machinery, sensors and control systems together.[45]\\nDigital control systems to automate process controls, operator tools and service information systems to optimize plant safety and security are within the purview of the IIoT.[63] But it also extends itself to asset management via predictive maintenance, statistical evaluation, and measurements to maximize reliability.[64] Industrial management systems can also be integrated with smart grids, enabling real-time energy optimization. Measurements, automated controls, plant optimization, health and safety management, and other functions are provided by a large number of networked sensors.[45]\\nIndustrial IoT (IIoT) in manufacturing could generate so much business value that it will eventually lead to the Fourth Industrial Revolution, also referred to as Industry 4.0. The potential for growth from implementing IIoT may generate $12 trillion of global GDP by 2030.[65]\\nIndustrial big data analytics will play a vital role in manufacturing asset predictive maintenance, although that is not the only capability of industrial big data.[66] Cyber-physical systems (CPS) is the core technology of industrial big data and it will be an interface between human and the cyber world.\\n\\nAgriculture[edit]\\nThere are numerous IoT applications in farming[67] such as collecting data on temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind speed, pest infestation, and soil content. This data can be used to automate farming techniques, take informed decisions to improve quality and quantity, minimize risk and waste, and reduce effort required to manage crops. For example, farmers can now monitor soil temperature and moisture from afar, and even apply IoT-acquired data to precision fertilization programs.[68]\\nIn August 2018, Toyota Tsusho began a partnership with Microsoft to create fish farming tools using the Microsoft Azure application suite for IoT technologies related to water management. Developed in part by researchers from Kindai University, the water pump mechanisms use artificial intelligence to count the number of fish on a conveyor belt, analyze the number of fish, and deduce the effectiveness of water flow from the data the fish provide. The specific computer programs used in the process fall under the Azure Machine Learning and the Azure IoT Hub platforms.[69]\\n\\nInfrastructure applications[edit]\\nMonitoring and controlling operations of sustainable urban and rural infrastructures like bridges, railway tracks and on- and offshore wind-farms is a key application of the IoT.[63] The IoT infrastructure can be used for monitoring any events or changes in structural conditions that can compromise safety and increase risk. The IoT can benefit the construction industry by cost saving, time reduction, better quality workday, paperless workflow and increase in productivity. It can help in taking faster decisions and save money with Real-Time Data Analytics. It can also be used for scheduling repair and maintenance activities in an efficient manner, by coordinating tasks between different service providers and users of these facilities.[45] IoT devices can also be used to control critical infrastructure like bridges to provide access to ships. Usage of IoT devices for monitoring and operating infrastructure is likely to improve incident management and emergency response coordination, and quality of service, up-times and reduce costs of operation in all infrastructure related areas.[70] Even areas such as waste management can benefit[71] from automation and optimization that could be brought in by the IoT.[citation needed]\\n\\nMetropolitan scale deployments[edit]\\nThere are several planned or ongoing large-scale deployments of the IoT, to enable better management of cities and systems. For example, Songdo, South Korea, the first of its kind fully equipped and wired smart city, is gradually being built, with approximately 70 percent of the business district completed as of June\\xc2\\xa02018[update]. Much of the city is planned to be wired and automated, with little or no human intervention.[72][73]\\nAnother application is a currently undergoing project in Santander, Spain. For this deployment, two approaches have been adopted. This city of 180,000 inhabitants has already seen 18,000 downloads of its city smartphone app. The app is connected to 10,000 sensors that enable services like parking search, environmental monitoring, digital city agenda, and more. City context information is used in this deployment so as to benefit merchants through a spark deals mechanism based on city behavior that aims at maximizing the impact of each notification.[74]\\nOther examples of large-scale deployments underway include the Sino-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City;[75] work on improving air and water quality, reducing noise pollution, and increasing transportation efficiency in San Jose, California;[76] and smart traffic management in western Singapore.[77] Using its RPMA (Random Phase Multiple Access) technology, San Diego-based Ingenu has built a nationwide public network[78] for low-bandwidth data transmissions using the same unlicensed 2.4 gigahertz spectrum as Wi-Fi. Ingenu\\'s \"Machine Network\" covers more than a third of the US population across 35 major cities including San Diego and Dallas.[79] French company, Sigfox, commenced building an Ultra Narrowband wireless data network in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2014, the first business to achieve such a deployment in the U.S.[80][81] It subsequently announced it would set up a total of 4000 base stations to cover a total of 30 cities in the U.S. by the end of 2016, making it the largest IoT network coverage provider in the country thus far.[82][83] Cisco also participates in smart cities projects. Cisco has started deploying technologies for Smart Wi-Fi, Smart Safety & Security, Smart Lighting, Smart Parking, Smart Transports, Smart Bus Stops, Smart Kiosks, Remote Expert for Government Services (REGS) and Smart Education in the five km area in the city of Vijaywada.[84]\\nAnother example of a large deployment is the one completed by New York Waterways in New York City to connect all the city\\'s vessels and be able to monitor them live 24/7. The network was designed and engineered by Fluidmesh Networks, a Chicago-based company developing wireless networks for critical applications. The NYWW network is currently providing coverage on the Hudson River, East River, and Upper New York Bay. With the wireless network in place, NY Waterway is able to take control of its fleet and passengers in a way that was not previously possible. New applications can include security, energy and fleet management, digital signage, public Wi-Fi, paperless ticketing and others.[85]\\n\\nEnergy management[edit]\\nSignificant numbers of energy-consuming devices (e.g. lamps, household appliances, motors, pumps, etc.) already integrate Internet connectivity, which can allow them to communicate with utilities not only to balance power generation but also helps optimize the energy consumption as a whole.[45] These devices allow for remote control by users, or central management via a cloud-based interface, and enable functions like scheduling (e.g., remotely powering on or off heating systems, controlling ovens, changing lighting conditions etc.).[45] The smart grid is a utility-side IoT application; systems gather and act on energy and power-related information to improve the efficiency of the production and distribution of electricity.[86] Using advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) Internet-connected devices, electric utilities not only collect data from end-users, but also manage distribution automation devices like transformers.[45]\\n\\nEnvironmental monitoring[edit]\\nEnvironmental monitoring applications of the IoT typically use sensors to assist in environmental protection[87] by monitoring air or water quality,[88] atmospheric or soil conditions,[89] and can even include areas like monitoring the movements of wildlife and their habitats.[90] Development of resource-constrained devices connected to the Internet also means that other applications like earthquake or tsunami early-warning systems can also be used by emergency services to provide more effective aid. IoT devices in this application typically span a large geographic area and can also be mobile.[45] It has been argued that the standardization IoT brings to wireless sensing will revolutionize this area.[91]\\nLiving Lab\\nAnother example of integrating the IoT is Living Lab which integrates and combines research and innovation process, establishing within a public-private-people-partnership.[92] There are currently 320 Living Labs that use the IoT to collaborate and share knowledge between stakeholders to co-create innovative and technological products. For companies to implement and develop IoT services for smart cities, they need to have incentives. The governments play key roles in smart cities projects as changes in policies will help cities to implement the IoT which provides effectiveness, efficiency, and accuracy of the resources that are being used. For instance, the government provides tax incentives and cheap rent, improves public transports, and offers an environment where start-up companies, creative industries, and multinationals may co-create, share common infrastructure and labor markets, and take advantages of locally embedded technologies, production process, and transaction costs.[92] The relationship between the technology developers and governments who manage city\\'s assets, is key to provide open access of resources to users in an efficient way.\\n\\nMilitary applications[edit]\\nMain article: Internet of Military Things\\nThe Internet of Military Things (IoMT) is the application of IoT technologies in the military domain for the purposes of reconnaissance, surveillance, and other combat-related objectives. It is heavily influenced by the future prospects of warfare in an urban environment and involves the use of sensors, munitions, vehicles, robots, human-wearable biometrics, and other smart technology that is relevant on the battlefield.[93]\\n\\nInternet of Battlefield Things[edit]\\nThe Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) is a project initiated and executed by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) that focuses on the basic science related to IoT that enhance the capabilities of Army soldiers.[94] In 2017, ARL launched the Internet of Battlefield Things Collaborative Research Alliance (IoBT-CRA), establishing a working collaboration between industry, university, and Army researchers to advance the theoretical foundations of IoT technologies and their applications to Army operations.[95][96]\\n\\nOcean of Things[edit]\\nThe Ocean of Things project is a DARPA-led program designed to establish an Internet of Things across large ocean areas for the purposes of collecting, monitoring, and analyzing environmental and vessel activity data. The project entails the deployment of about 50,000 floats that house a passive sensor suite that autonomously detect and track military and commercial vessels as part of a cloud-based network.[97]\\n\\nProduct digitisation[edit]\\nThere are several applications of smart or active packaging  in which a QR code or  NFC tag  is  affixed on a product or its packaging. The  tag  itself is passive, however it  contains a unique identifier (typically a URL)  which enables  a user to  access  digital content about the product via a smartphone.[98] Strictly speaking, such passive items are not part of the Internet of Thing but they can be seen as enablers of digital interactions.[99]  The term \"Internet of Packaging\" has been coined to describe applications in which unique identifiers are used, to automate supply chains, and  are scanned on large scale by consumers to access digital content.[100] Authentication of the unique identifiers, and thereby of the product itself, is possible via a copy-sensitive digital watermark or copy detection pattern for scanning when scanning a QR Code,[101] while  NFC tags can encrypt communication.[102]\\n\\nTrends and characteristics[edit]\\n Technology roadmap: Internet of things\\nThe IoT\\'s major significant trend in recent years is the explosive growth of devices connected and controlled by the Internet.[103] The wide range of applications for IoT technology mean that the specifics can be very different from one device to the next but there are basic characteristics shared by most.\\nThe IoT creates opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into computer-based systems, resulting in efficiency improvements, economic benefits, and reduced human exertions.[104][105][106][107]\\nThe number of IoT devices increased 31% year-over-year to 8.4 billion in the year 2017[108] and it is estimated that there will be 30 billion devices by 2020.[103] The global market value of IoT is projected to reach $7.1 trillion by 2020.[109]\\n\\nIntelligence[edit]\\nAmbient intelligence and autonomous control are not part of the original concept of the Internet of things. Ambient intelligence and autonomous control do not necessarily require Internet structures, either. However, there is a shift in research (by companies such as Intel) to integrate the concepts of the IoT and autonomous control, with initial outcomes towards this direction considering objects as the driving force for autonomous IoT.[110] A promising approach in this context is deep reinforcement learning where most of IoT systems provide a dynamic and interactive environment.[111] Training an agent (i.e., IoT device) to behave smartly in such an environment cannot be addressed by conventional machine learning algorithms such as supervised learning. By reinforcement learning approach, a learning agent can sense the environment\\'s state (e.g., sensing home temperature), perform actions (e.g., turn HVAC on or off) and learn through the maximizing accumulated rewards it receives in long term.\\nIoT intelligence can be offered at three levels: IoT devices, Edge/Fog nodes, and Cloud computing.[112] The need for intelligent control and decision at each level depends on the time sensitiveness of the IoT application. For example, an autonomous vehicle\\'s camera needs to make real-time obstacle detection to avoid an accident. This fast decision making would not be possible through transferring data from the vehicle to cloud instances and return the predictions back to the vehicle. Instead, all the operation should be performed locally in the vehicle. Integrating advanced machine learning algorithms including deep learning into IoT devices is an active research area to make smart objects closer to reality. Moreover, it is possible to get the most value out of IoT deployments through analyzing IoT data, extracting hidden information, and predicting control decisions. A wide variety of machine learning techniques have been used in IoT domain ranging from traditional methods such as regression, support vector machine, and random forest to advanced ones such as convolutional neural networks, LSTM, and variational autoencoder.[113][112]\\nIn the future, the Internet of Things may be a non-deterministic and open network in which auto-organized or intelligent entities (web services, SOA components) and virtual objects (avatars) will be interoperable and able to act independently (pursuing their own objectives or shared ones) depending on the context, circumstances or environments. Autonomous behavior through the collection and reasoning of context information as well as the object\\'s ability to detect changes in the environment (faults affecting sensors) and introduce suitable mitigation measures constitutes a major research trend,[114] clearly needed to provide credibility to the IoT technology. Modern IoT products and solutions in the marketplace use a variety of different technologies to support such context-aware automation, but more sophisticated forms of intelligence are requested to permit sensor units and intelligent cyber-physical systems to be deployed in real environments.[115]\\n\\nArchitecture[edit]\\nThis section needs attention from an expert in technology. The specific problem is: The information is partially outdated, unclear, and uncited. Requires more details, but not so technical that others won\\'t understand it.. WikiProject Technology may be able to help recruit an expert. (July 2018)\\nIoT system architecture, in its simplistic view, consists of three tiers:  Tier 1: Devices, Tier 2: the Edge Gateway, and Tier 3: the Cloud.[116] Devices include networked things, such as the sensors and actuators found in IIoT equipment, particularly those that use protocols such as Modbus, Bluetooth, Zigbee, or proprietary protocols, to connect to an Edge Gateway.[116] The Edge Gateway consists of sensor data aggregation systems called Edge Gateways that provide functionality, such as pre-processing of the data, securing connectivity to cloud, using systems such as WebSockets, the event hub, and, even in some cases, edge analytics or fog computing.[116] Edge Gateway layer is also required to give a common view of the devices to the upper layers to facilitate in easier management. The final tier includes the cloud application built for IIoT using the microservices architecture, which are usually polyglot and inherently secure in nature using HTTPS/OAuth. It includes various database systems that store sensor data, such as time series databases or asset stores using backend data storage systems (e.g. Cassandra, PostgreSQL).[116] The cloud tier in most cloud-based IoT system features event queuing and messaging system that handles communication that transpires in all tiers.[117] Some experts classified the three-tiers in the IIoT system as edge, platform, and enterprise and these are connected by proximity network, access network, and service network, respectively.[118]\\nBuilding on the Internet of things, the web of things is an architecture for the application layer of the Internet of things looking at the convergence of data from IoT devices into Web applications to create innovative use-cases. In order to program and control the flow of information in the Internet of things, a predicted architectural direction is being called BPM Everywhere which is a blending of traditional process management with process mining and special capabilities to automate the control of large numbers of coordinated devices.[citation needed]\\n\\nNetwork architecture[edit]\\nThe Internet of things requires huge scalability in the network space to handle the surge of devices.[119] IETF 6LoWPAN would be used to connect devices to IP networks. With billions of devices[120] being added to the Internet space, IPv6 will play a major role in handling the network layer scalability. IETF\\'s Constrained Application Protocol, ZeroMQ, and MQTT would provide lightweight data transport.\\nFog computing is a viable alternative to prevent such large burst of data flow through Internet.[121] The edge devices\\' computation power to analyse and process data is extremely limited. Limited processing power is a key attribute of IoT devices as their purpose is to supply data about physical objects while remaining autonomous. Heavy processing requirements use more battery power harming IoT\\'s ability to operate. Scalability is easy because IoT devices simply supply data through the internet to a server with sufficient processing power.[122]\\n\\nComplexity[edit]\\nIn semi-open or closed loops (i.e. value chains, whenever a global finality can be settled) the IoT will often be considered and studied as a complex system[123] due to the huge number of different links, interactions between autonomous actors, and its capacity to integrate new actors. At the overall stage (full open loop) it will likely be seen as a chaotic environment (since systems always have finality).\\nAs a practical approach, not all elements in the Internet of things run in a global, public space. Subsystems are often implemented to mitigate the risks of privacy, control and reliability. For example, domestic robotics (domotics) running inside a smart home might only share data within and be available via a local network.[124] Managing and controlling a high dynamic ad hoc IoT things/devices network is a tough task with the traditional networks architecture, Software Defined Networking (SDN) provides the agile dynamic solution that can cope with the special requirements of the diversity of innovative IoT applications.[125]\\n\\nSize considerations[edit]\\nThe Internet of things would encode 50 to 100 trillion objects, and be able to follow the movement of those objects. Human beings in surveyed urban environments are each surrounded by 1000 to 5000 trackable objects.[126] In 2015 there were already 83 million smart devices in people\\'s homes. This number is expected to grow to 193 million devices by 2020.[27]\\nThe figure of online capable devices grew 31% from 2016 to 2017 to reach 8.4 billion.[108]\\n\\nSpace considerations[edit]\\nIn the Internet of Things, the precise geographic location of a thing\\xe2\\x80\\x94and also the precise geographic dimensions of a thing\\xe2\\x80\\x94will be critical.[127] Therefore, facts about a thing, such as its location in time and space, have been less critical to track because the person processing the information can decide whether or not that information was important to the action being taken, and if so, add the missing information (or decide to not take the action). (Note that some things in the Internet of Things will be sensors, and sensor location is usually important.[128]) The GeoWeb and Digital Earth are promising applications that become possible when things can become organized and connected by location. However, the challenges that remain include the constraints of variable spatial scales, the need to handle massive amounts of data, and an indexing for fast search and neighbor operations. In the Internet of Things, if things are able to take actions on their own initiative, this human-centric mediation role is eliminated. Thus, the time-space context that we as humans take for granted must be given a central role in this information ecosystem. Just as standards play a key role in the Internet and the Web, geospatial standards will play a key role in the Internet of things.[129][130]\\n\\nA solution to \"basket of remotes\"[edit]\\nMany IoT devices have a potential to take a piece of this market. Jean-Louis Gass\\xc3\\xa9e (Apple initial alumni team, and BeOS co-founder) has addressed this topic in an article on Monday Note,[131] where he predicts that the most likely problem will be what he calls the \"basket of remotes\" problem, where we\\'ll have hundreds of applications to interface with hundreds of devices that don\\'t share protocols for speaking with one another.[131] For improved user interaction, some technology leaders are joining forces to create standards for communication between devices to solve this problem. Others are turning to the concept of predictive interaction of devices, \"where collected data is used to predict and trigger actions on the specific devices\" while making them work together.[132]\\n\\nEnabling technologies for IoT[edit]\\nThere are many technologies that enable the IoT. Crucial to the field is the network used to communicate between devices of an IoT installation, a role that several wireless or wired technologies may fulfill:[133][134][135]\\n\\nAddressability[edit]\\nThe original idea of the Auto-ID Center is based on RFID-tags and distinct identification through the Electronic Product Code. This has evolved into objects having an IP address or URI.[136] An alternative view, from the world of the Semantic Web[137] focuses instead on making all things (not just those electronic, smart, or RFID-enabled) addressable by the existing naming protocols, such as URI. The objects themselves do not converse, but they may now be referred to by other agents, such as powerful centralized servers acting for their human owners.[138] Integration with the Internet implies that devices will use an IP address as a distinct identifier. Due to the limited address space of IPv4 (which allows for 4.3 billion different addresses), objects in the IoT will have to use the next generation of the Internet protocol (IPv6) to scale to the extremely large address space required.[139][140][141]\\nInternet-of-things devices additionally will benefit from the stateless address auto-configuration present in IPv6,[142] as it reduces the configuration overhead on the hosts,[140] and the IETF 6LoWPAN header compression. To a large extent, the future of the Internet of things will not be possible without the support of IPv6; and consequently, the global adoption of IPv6 in the coming years will be critical for the successful development of the IoT in the future.[141]\\n\\nApplication Layer[edit]\\nADRC[143] defines an application layer protocol and supporting framework for implementing IoT applications.\\nShort-range wireless[edit]\\nBluetooth mesh networking \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Specification providing a mesh networking variant to Bluetooth low energy (BLE) with increased number of nodes and standardized application layer (Models).\\nLight-Fidelity (Li-Fi) \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Wireless communication technology similar to the Wi-Fi standard, but using visible light communication for increased bandwidth.\\nNear-field communication (NFC) \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Communication protocols enabling two electronic devices to communicate within a 4\\xc2\\xa0cm range.\\nRadio-frequency identification (RFID) \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Technology using electromagnetic fields to read data stored in tags embedded in other items.\\nWi-Fi \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Technology for local area networking based on the IEEE 802.11 standard, where devices may communicate through a shared access point or directly between individual devices.\\nZigBee \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Communication protocols for personal area networking based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, providing low power consumption, low data rate, low cost, and high throughput.\\nZ-Wave \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Wireless communications protocol used primarily for home automation and security applications\\nMedium-range wireless[edit]\\nLTE-Advanced \\xe2\\x80\\x93 High-speed communication specification for mobile networks.

(September 2016)\\nThis is a list of technical standards for the IoT, most of which are open standards, and the standards organizations that aspire to successfully setting them.[145][146]\\n\\n\\n\\nShort name\\n\\nLong name\\n\\nStandards under development\\n\\nOther notes\\n\\n\\nAuto-ID Labs\\nAuto Identification Center\\nNetworked RFID (radiofrequency identification) and emerging sensing technologies\\n\\n\\n\\nEPCglobal\\nElectronic Product code Technology\\nStandards for adoption of EPC (Electronic Product Code) technology\\n\\n\\n\\nFDA\\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration\\nUDI (Unique Device Identification) system for distinct identifiers for medical devices\\n\\n\\n\\nGS1\\nGlobal Standards One\\nStandards for UIDs (\"unique\" identifiers) and RFID of fast-moving consumer goods (consumer packaged goods), health care supplies, and other things\\nThe GS1 digital link standard,[147] first released in August 2018, allows the use QR Codes, GS1 Datamatrix, RFID and NFC to enable various types of business-to-business, as well as business-to-consumers interactions.\\n\\n\\nParent organization comprises member organizations such as GS1 US\\n\\n\\nIEEE\\nInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers\\nUnderlying communication technology standards such as IEEE 802.15.4, IEEE P1451-99 (IoT Harmonization), and IEEE P1931.1 (ROOF Computing).\\n\\n\\n\\nIETF\\nInternet Engineering Task Force\\nStandards that comprise TCP/IP (the Internet protocol suite)\\n\\n\\n\\nMTConnect Institute\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nMTConnect is a manufacturing industry standard for data exchange with machine tools and related industrial equipment.

Philip N. Howard, a professor and author, writes that political life in both democracies and authoritarian regimes will be shaped by the way the IoT will be used for civic engagement. For that to happen, he argues that any connected device should be able to divulge a list of the \"ultimate beneficiaries\" of its sensor data and that individual citizens should be able to add new organizations to the beneficiary list. In addition, he argues that civil society groups need to start developing their IoT strategy for making use of data and engaging with the public.[148]\\n\\nGovernment regulation on IoT[edit]\\nOne of the key drivers of the IoT is data. The success of the idea of connecting devices to make them more efficient is dependent upon access to and storage & processing of data. For this purpose, companies working on the IoT collect data from multiple sources and store it in their cloud network for further processing. This leaves the door wide open for privacy and security dangers and single point vulnerability of multiple systems.[149] The other issues pertain to consumer choice and ownership of data[150] and how it is used. Though still in their infancy, regulations and governance regarding these issues of privacy, security, and data ownership continue to develop.[151][152][153] IoT regulation depends on the country. Some examples of legislation that is relevant to privacy and data collection are: the US Privacy Act of 1974, OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data of 1980, and the EU Directive 95/46/EC of 1995.[154]\\nCurrent regulatory environment:\\nA report published by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in January 2015 made the following three recommendations:[155]\\n\\nData security \\xe2\\x80\\x93 At the time of designing IoT companies should ensure that data collection, storage and processing would be secure at all times. Companies should adopt a \"defence in depth\" approach and encrypt data at each stage.[156]\\nData consent \\xe2\\x80\\x93 users should have a choice as to what data they share with IoT companies and the users must be informed if their data gets exposed.\\nData minimization \\xe2\\x80\\x93 IoT companies should collect only the data they need and retain the collected information only for a limited time.\\nHowever, the FTC stopped at just making recommendations for now. According to an FTC analysis, the existing framework, consisting of the FTC Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and the Children\\'s Online Privacy Protection Act, along with developing consumer education and business guidance, participation in multi-stakeholder efforts and advocacy to other agencies at the federal, state and local level, is sufficient to protect consumer rights.[157]\\nA resolution passed by the Senate in March 2015, is already being considered by the Congress.[158] This resolution recognized the need for formulating a National Policy on IoT and the matter of privacy, security and spectrum. Furthermore, to provide an impetus to the IoT ecosystem, in March 2016, a bipartisan group of four Senators proposed a bill, The Developing Innovation and Growing the Internet of Things (DIGIT) Act, to direct the Federal Communications Commission to assess the need for more spectrum to connect IoT devices.\\nApproved on 28 September 2018, Senate Bill No. 327[159] goes into effect on 1 January 2020. The bill requires \"a manufacturer of a connected device, as those terms are defined, to equip the device with a reasonable security feature or features that are appropriate to the nature and function of the device, appropriate to the information it may collect, contain, or transmit, and designed to protect the device and any information contained therein from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure,\"\\nSeveral standards for the IoT industry are actually being established relating to automobiles because most concerns arising from use of connected cars apply to healthcare devices as well. In fact, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is preparing cybersecurity guidelines and a database of best practices to make automotive computer systems more secure.[160]\\nA recent report from the World Bank examines the challenges and opportunities in government adoption of IoT.[161] These include \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\n\\nStill early days for the IoT in government\\xc2\\xa0\\nUnderdeveloped policy and regulatory frameworks\\xc2\\xa0\\nUnclear business models, despite strong value proposition\\xc2\\xa0\\nClear institutional and capacity gap in government AND the private sector\\xc2\\xa0\\nInconsistent data valuation and management\\xc2\\xa0\\nInfrastructure a major barrier\\xc2\\xa0\\nGovernment as an enabler\\xc2\\xa0\\nMost successful pilots share common characteristics (public-private partnership, local, leadership)\\nCriticism, problems and controversies[edit]\\nPlatform fragmentation[edit]\\nThe IoT suffers from platform fragmentation, lack of interoperability and common technical standards[162][163][164][165][166][167][168][excessive citations] a situation where the variety of IoT devices, in terms of both hardware variations and differences in the software running on them, makes the task of developing applications that work consistently between different inconsistent technology ecosystems hard.[1] For example, wireless connectivity for IoT devices can be done using Bluetooth, Zigbee, Z-Wave, LoRa, NB-IoT, Cat M1 as well as completely custom proprietary radios \\xe2\\x80\\x93 each with its own advantages and disadvantages; and unique support ecosystem.[169]\\nThe IoT\\'s amorphous computing nature is also a problem for security, since patches to bugs found in the core operating system often do not reach users of older and lower-price devices.[170][171][172] One set of researchers say that the failure of vendors to support older devices with patches and updates leaves more than 87% of active Android devices vulnerable.[173][174]\\n\\nPrivacy, autonomy, and control[edit]\\nPhilip N. Howard, a professor and author, writes that the Internet of Things offers immense potential for empowering citizens, making government transparent, and broadening information access. Howard cautions, however, that privacy threats are enormous, as is the potential for social control and political manipulation.[175]\\nConcerns about privacy have led many to consider the possibility that big data infrastructures such as the Internet of things and data mining are inherently incompatible with privacy.[176] Key challenges of increased digitalization in the water, transport or energy sector are related to privacy and cybersecurity which necessitate an adequate response from research and policymakers alike.[177]\\nWriter Adam Greenfield claims that IoT technologies are not only an invasion of public space but are also being used to perpetuate normative behavior, citing an instance of billboards with hidden cameras that tracked the demographics of passersby who stopped to read the advertisement.\\nThe Internet of Things Council compared the increased prevalence of digital surveillance due to the Internet of things to the conceptual panopticon described by Jeremy Bentham in the 18th Century.[178] The assertion was defended by the works of French philosophers Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze. In Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison Foucault asserts that the panopticon was a central element of the discipline society developed during the Industrial Era.[179] Foucault also argued that the discipline systems established in factories and school reflected Bentham\\'s vision of panopticism.[179] In his 1992 paper \"Postscripts on the Societies of Control,\" Deleuze wrote that the discipline society had transitioned into a control society, with the computer replacing the panopticon as an instrument of discipline and control while still maintaining the qualities similar to that of panopticism.[180]\\nPeter-Paul Verbeek, a professor of philosophy of technology at the University of Twente, Netherlands, writes that technology already influences our moral decision making, which in turn affects human agency, privacy and autonomy. He cautions against viewing technology merely as a human tool and advocates instead to consider it as an active agent.[181]\\nJustin Brookman, of the Center for Democracy and Technology, expressed concern regarding the impact of the IoT on consumer privacy, saying that \"There are some people in the commercial space who say, \\'Oh, big data \\xe2\\x80\\x93 well, let\\'s collect everything, keep it around forever, we\\'ll pay for somebody to think about security later.\\' The question is whether we want to have some sort of policy framework in place to limit that.\"[182]\\nTim O\\'Reilly believes that the way companies sell the IoT devices on consumers are misplaced, disputing the notion that the IoT is about gaining efficiency from putting all kinds of devices online and postulating that the \"IoT is really about human augmentation. The applications are profoundly different when you have sensors and data driving the decision-making.\"[183]\\nEditorials at WIRED have also expressed concern, one stating \"What you\\'re about to lose is your privacy. Actually, it\\'s worse than that. You aren\\'t just going to lose your privacy, you\\'re going to have to watch the very concept of privacy be rewritten under your nose.\"[184]\\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) expressed concern regarding the ability of IoT to erode people\\'s control over their own lives. The ACLU wrote that \"There\\'s simply no way to forecast how these immense powers \\xe2\\x80\\x93 disproportionately accumulating in the hands of corporations seeking financial advantage and governments craving ever more control \\xe2\\x80\\x93 will be used. Chances are big data and the Internet of things will make it harder for us to control our own lives, as we grow increasingly transparent to powerful corporations and government institutions that are becoming more opaque to us.\"[185]\\nIn response to rising concerns about privacy and smart technology, in 2007 the British Government stated it would follow formal Privacy by Design principles when implementing their smart metering program. The program would lead to replacement of traditional power meters with smart power meters, which could track and manage energy usage more accurately.[186] However the British Computer Society is doubtful these principles were ever actually implemented.[187] In 2009 the Dutch Parliament rejected a similar smart metering program, basing their decision on privacy concerns. The Dutch program later revised and passed in 2011.[187]\\n\\nData storage[edit]\\nA challenge for producers of IoT applications is to clean, process and interpret the vast amount of data which is gathered by the sensors. There is a solution proposed for the analytics of the information referred to as Wireless Sensor Networks.[188] These networks share data among sensor nodes that are sent to a distributed system for the analytics of the sensory data.[189]\\nAnother challenge is the storage of this bulk data. Depending on the application, there could be high data acquisition requirements, which in turn lead to high storage requirements. Currently the Internet is already responsible for 5% of the total energy generated,[188] and a \"daunting challenge to power\" IoT devices to collect and even store data still remains.[190]\\n\\nSecurity[edit]\\nSecurity is the biggest concern in adopting Internet of things technology,[191] with concerns that rapid development is happening without appropriate consideration of the profound security challenges involved[192] and the regulatory changes that might be necessary.[193][194]\\nMost of the technical security concerns are similar to those of conventional servers, workstations and smartphones,[195] and include weak authentication, forgetting to change default credentials, unencrypted messages sent between devices, SQL injections and poor handling of security updates.[196] However, many IoT devices have severe operational limitations on the computational power available to them.\\xc2\\xa0 These constraints often make them unable to directly use basic security measures such as implementing firewalls or using strong cryptosystems to encrypt their communications with other devices[197] - and the low price and consumer focus of many devices makes a robust security patching system uncommon.[198]\\nInternet of Things devices also have access to new areas of data, and can often control physical devices,[199] so that even by 2014 it was possible to say that many Internet-connected appliances could already \"spy on people in their own homes\" including televisions, kitchen appliances,[200] cameras, and thermostats.[201] Computer-controlled devices in automobiles such as brakes, engine, locks, hood and trunk releases, horn, heat, and dashboard have been shown to be vulnerable to attackers who have access to the on-board network. In some cases, vehicle computer systems are Internet-connected, allowing them to be exploited remotely.[202] By 2008 security researchers had shown the ability to remotely control pacemakers without authority. Later hackers demonstrated remote control of insulin pumps[203] and implantable cardioverter defibrillators.[204]\\nPoorly secured Internet-accessible IoT devices can also be subverted to attack others. In 2016, a distributed denial of service attack powered by Internet of things devices running the Mirai malware took down a DNS provider and major web sites.[205] The Mirai Botnet had infected roughly 65,000 IoT devices within the first 20 hours.[206] Eventually the infections increased to around 200,000 to 300,000 infections.[206] Brazil, Colombia and Vietnam made up of 41.5% of the infections.[206] The Mirai Botnet had singled out specific IoT devices that consisted of DVRs, IP cameras, routers and printers.[206] Top vendors that contained the most infected devices were identified as Dahua, Huawei, ZTE, Cisco, ZyXEL and MikroTik.[206] In May 2017, Junade Ali, a Computer Scientist at Cloudflare noted that native DDoS vulnerabilities exist in IoT devices due to a poor implementation of the Publish\\xe2\\x80\\x93subscribe pattern.[207][208] These sorts of attacks have caused security experts to view IoT as a real threat to Internet services.[209]\\nThe U.S. National Intelligence Council in an unclassified report maintains that it would be hard to deny \"access to networks of sensors and remotely-controlled objects by enemies of the United States, criminals, and mischief makers... An open market for aggregated sensor data could serve the interests of commerce and security no less than it helps criminals and spies identify vulnerable targets. Thus, massively parallel sensor fusion may undermine social cohesion, if it proves to be fundamentally incompatible with Fourth-Amendment guarantees against unreasonable search.\"[210] In general, the intelligence community views the Internet of things as a rich source of data.[211]\\nOn 31 January 2019, the Washington Post wrote an article regarding the security and ethical challenges that can occur with IoT doorbells and cameras: \"Last month, Ring got caught allowing its team in Ukraine to view and annotate certain user videos; the company says it only looks at publicly shared videos and those from Ring owners who provide consent. Just last week, a California family\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Nest camera let a hacker take over and broadcast fake audio warnings about a missile attack, not to mention peer in on them, when they used a weak password\"[212]\\nThere have been a range of responses to concerns over security. The Internet of Things Security Foundation (IoTSF) was launched on 23 September 2015 with a mission to secure the Internet of things by promoting knowledge and best practice. Its founding board is made from technology providers and telecommunications companies. In addition, large IT companies are continually developing innovative solutions to ensure the security of IoT devices. In 2017, Mozilla launched Project Things, which allows to route IoT devices through a safe Web of Things gateway.[213] As per the estimates from KBV Research,[214] the overall IoT security market[215] would grow at 27.9% rate during 2016\\xe2\\x80\\x932022 as a result of growing infrastructural concerns and diversified usage of Internet of things.[216][217]\\nGovernmental regulation is argued by some to be necessary to secure IoT devices and the wider Internet \\xe2\\x80\\x93 as market incentives to secure IoT devices is insufficient.[218][193][194] It was found that due to the nature of most of the IoT development boards, they generate predictable and weak keys which make it easy to be utilized by MiTM attack. However, various hardening approaches were proposed by many researchers to resolve the issue of SSH weak implementation and weak keys.[219]\\n\\nSafety[edit]\\nIoT systems are typically controlled by event-driven smart apps that take as input either sensed data, user inputs, or other external triggers (from the Internet) and command one or more actuators towards providing different forms of automation.[220] Examples of sensors include smoke detectors, motion sensors, and contact sensors. Examples of actuators include smart locks, smart power outlets, and door controls. Popular control platforms on which third-party developers can build smart apps that interact wirelessly with these sensors and actuators include Samsung\\'s SmartThings,[221] Apple\\'s HomeKit,[222] and Amazon\\'s Alexa,[223] among others.\\nA problem specific to IoT systems is that buggy apps, unforeseen bad app interactions, or device/communication failures, can cause unsafe and dangerous physical states, e.g., \"unlock the entrance door when no one is at home\" or \"turn off the heater when the temperature is below 0 degrees Celsius and people are sleeping at night\".[220] Detecting flaws that lead to such states, requires a holistic view of installed apps, component devices, their configurations, and more importantly, how they interact. Recently, researchers from the University of California Riverside have proposed IotSan, a novel practical system that uses model checking as a building block to reveal \"interaction-level\" flaws by identifying events that can lead the system to unsafe states.[220] They have evaluated IotSan on the Samsung SmartThings platform. From 76 manually configured systems, IotSan detects 147 vulnerabilities (i.e., violations of safe physical states/properties).\\n\\nDesign[edit]\\nGiven widespread recognition of the evolving nature of the design and management of the Internet of Things, sustainable and secure deployment of IoT solutions must design for \"anarchic scalability.\"[224] Application of the concept of anarchic scalability can be extended to physical systems (i.e. controlled real-world objects), by virtue of those systems being designed to account for uncertain management futures. This hard anarchic scalability thus provides a pathway forward to fully realize the potential of Internet-of-things solutions by selectively constraining physical systems to allow for all management regimes without risking physical failure.[224]\\nBrown University computer scientist Michael Littman has argued that successful execution of the Internet of Things requires consideration of the interface\\'s usability as well as the technology itself. These interfaces need to be not only more user-friendly but also better integrated: \"If users need to learn different interfaces for their vacuums, their locks, their sprinklers, their lights, and their coffeemakers, it\\'s tough to say that their lives have been made any easier.\"[225]\\n\\nEnvironmental sustainability impact[edit]\\nA concern regarding Internet-of-things technologies pertains to the environmental impacts of the manufacture, use, and eventual disposal of all these semiconductor-rich devices.[226] Modern electronics are replete with a wide variety of heavy metals and rare-earth metals, as well as highly toxic synthetic chemicals. This makes them extremely difficult to properly recycle. Electronic components are often incinerated or placed in regular landfills. Furthermore, the human and environmental cost of mining the rare-earth metals that are integral to modern electronic components continues to grow. This leads to societal questions concerning the environmental impacts of IoT devices over its lifetime.[227]\\nAlthough IoT devices can help in some cases to reduce the energy consumption of certain applications, the impact of having billions of devices connected and consuming power from batteries and from the grid will have a huge impact on energy consumption and CO2 emissions. The technology developed by Omniflow [228] can house all kinds of DC powered IoT devices inside the protective shell that also integrates power generation from integrated vertical wind turbine and solar photovoltaic as well as energy storage using built-in batteries.\\n\\nIntentional obsolescence of devices[edit]\\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation has raised concerns that companies can use the technologies necessary to support connected devices to intentionally disable or \"brick\" their customers\\' devices via a remote software update or by disabling a service necessary to the operation of the device. In one example, home automation devices sold with the promise of a \"Lifetime Subscription\" were rendered useless after Nest Labs acquired Revolv and made the decision to shut down the central servers the Revolv devices had used to operate.[229] As Nest is a company owned by Alphabet (Google\\'s parent company), the EFF argues this sets a \"terrible precedent for a company with ambitions to sell self-driving cars, medical devices, and other high-end gadgets that may be essential to a person\\'s livelihood or physical safety.\"[230]\\nOwners should be free to point their devices to a different server or collaborate on improved software. But such action violates the United States DMCA section 1201, which only has an exemption for \"local use\". This forces tinkerers who want to keep using their own equipment into a legal grey area. EFF thinks buyers should refuse electronics and software that prioritize the manufacturer\\'s wishes above their own.[230]\\nExamples of post-sale manipulations include Google Nest Revolv, disabled privacy settings on Android, Sony disabling Linux on PlayStation 3, enforced EULA on Wii U.[230]\\n\\nConfusing terminology[edit]\\nKevin Lonergan at Information Age, a business technology magazine, has referred to the terms surrounding the IoT as a \"terminology zoo\".[231] The lack of clear terminology is not \"useful from a practical point of view\" and a \"source of confusion for the end user\".[231] A company operating in the IoT space could be working in anything related to sensor technology, networking, embedded systems, or analytics.[231] According to Lonergan, the term IoT was coined before smart phones, tablets, and devices as we know them today existed, and there is a long list of terms with varying degrees of overlap and technological convergence: Internet of things, Internet of everything (IoE), Internet of Goods (Supply Chain), industrial Internet, pervasive computing, pervasive sensing, ubiquitous computing, cyber-physical systems (CPS), wireless sensor networks (WSN), smart objects, digital twin, cyberobjects or avatars,[123] cooperating objects, machine to machine (M2M), ambient intelligence (AmI), Operational technology (OT), and information technology (IT).[231] Regarding IIoT, an industrial sub-field of IoT, the Industrial Internet Consortium\\'s Vocabulary Task Group has created a \"common and reusable vocabulary of terms\"[232] to ensure \"consistent terminology\"[232][233] across publications issued by the Industrial Internet Consortium. IoT One has created an IoT Terms Database including a New Term Alert[234] to be notified when a new term is published. As of March\\xc2\\xa02020[update], this database aggregates 807 IoT-related terms, while keeping material \"transparent and comprehensive.\"[235][236]\\n\\nIoT adoption barriers[edit]\\n GE Digital CEO William Ruh speaking about GE\\'s attempts to gain a foothold in the market for IoT services at the first IEEE Computer Society TechIgnite conference\\nLack of interoperability and unclear value propositions[edit]\\nDespite a shared belief in the potential of the IoT, industry leaders and consumers are facing barriers to adopt IoT technology more widely. Mike Farley argued in Forbes that while IoT solutions appeal to early adopters, they either lack interoperability or a clear use case for end-users.[237] A study by Ericsson regarding the adoption of IoT among Danish companies suggests that many struggle \"to pinpoint exactly where the value of IoT lies for them\".[238]\\n\\nPrivacy and security concerns[edit]\\nAs for IoT, information about a user\\'s daily routine is collected so that the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthings\\xe2\\x80\\x9d around the user can cooperate to provide better services that fulfill personal preference.[239] When the collected information which describes a user in detail travels through multiple hops in a network, due to a diverse integration of services, devices and network, the information stored on a device is vulnerable to privacy violation by compromising nodes existing in an IoT network.[240]\\nFor example, on 21 October 2016, a multiple distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks systems operated by domain name system provider Dyn, which caused the inaccessibility of several websites, such as GitHub, Twitter, and others. This attack is executed through a botnet consisting of a large number of IoT devices including IP cameras, gateways, and even baby monitors.[241]\\nFundamentally there are 4 security objectives that the IOT system requires:(1)data confidentiality: unauthorized parties cannot have access to the transmitted and stored data.(2)data integrity: intentional and unintentional corruption of transmitted and stored data must be detected.(3)non-repudiation: the sender cannot deny having sent a given message.(4)data availability: the transmitted and stored data should be available to authorized parties even with the denial-of-service (DOS) attacks.[242]\\n\\nTraditional governance structure[edit]\\n Town of Internet of Things in Hangzhou, China\\nA study issued by Ericsson regarding the adoption of Internet of things among Danish companies identified a \"clash between IoT and companies\\' traditional governance structures, as IoT still presents both uncertainties and a lack of historical precedence.\"[238] Among the respondents interviewed, 60 percent stated that they \"do not believe they have the organizational capabilities, and three of four do not believe they have the processes needed, to capture the IoT opportunity.\"[238] This has led to a need to understand organizational culture in order to facilitate organizational design processes and to test new innovation management practices. A lack of digital leadership in the age of digital transformation has also stifled innovation and IoT adoption to a degree that many companies, in the face of uncertainty, \"were waiting for the market dynamics to play out\",[238] or further action in regards to IoT \"was pending competitor moves, customer pull, or regulatory requirements.\"[238] Some of these companies risk being \\'kodaked\\' \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \"Kodak was a market leader until digital disruption eclipsed film photography with digital photos\" \\xe2\\x80\\x93 failing to \"see the disruptive forces affecting their industry\"[243] and \"to truly embrace the new business models the disruptive change opens up.\"[243] Scott Anthony has written in Harvard Business Review that Kodak \"created a digital camera, invested in the technology, and even understood that photos would be shared online\"[243] but ultimately failed to realize that \"online photo sharing was the new business, not just a way to expand the printing business.\"[243]\\n\\nBusiness planning and models[edit]\\nAccording to 2018 study, 70\\xe2\\x80\\x9375% of IoT deployments were stuck in the pilot or prototype stage, unable to reach scale due in part to a lack of business planning.[244][page\\xc2\\xa0needed][245]\\nStudies on IoT literature and projects show a disproportionate prominence of technology in the IoT projects, which are often driven by technological interventions rather than business model innovation.[246][247][improper synthesis?]\\n\\nSee also[edit]\\n\\n5G\\nAutomotive security\\nBig Data\\nCloud manufacturing\\nCyber-physical system\\nData Distribution Service\\nDigital object memory\\nDigital twin\\nEdge computing\\nFour-dimensional product\\nHome automation\\nIndoor positioning system\\nIndustry 4.0\\nInternet of Military Things\\nIoT Cloud\\nOpen Interconnect Consortium\\nOpenWSN\\nQuantified self\\nResponsive computer-aided design\\nSmart grid\\nWeb of things\\n\\nReferences[edit]\\n\\n\\n^ a b c Rouse, Margaret (2019). \"internet of things (IoT)\".

They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re like rush-hour gridlock trapping a Formula 1 race car.\\nBlockchain promises to solve this problem. The technology behind bitcoin, blockchain is an open, distributed ledger that records transactions safely, permanently, and very efficiently. For instance, while the transfer of a share of stock can now take up to a week, with blockchain it could happen in seconds. Blockchain could slash the cost of transactions and eliminate intermediaries like lawyers and bankers, and that could transform the economy. But, like the adoption of more internet technologies, blockchain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s adoption will require broad coordination and will take years. In this article the authors describe the path that blockchain is likely to follow and explain how firms should think about investments in it.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn Brief\\n\\nThe Hype\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve all heard that blockchain will revolutionize business, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to take a lot longer than many people claim.\\nThe Reason\\nLike TCP/IP (on which the internet was built), blockchain is a foundational technology that will require broad coordination. The level of complexity\\xe2\\x80\\x94technological, regulatory, and social\\xe2\\x80\\x94will be unprecedented.\\nThe Truth\\nThe adoption of TCP/IP suggests blockchain will follow a fairly predictable path. While the journey will take years, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not too early for businesses to start planning.\\n\\n\\n\\nLeer en espa\\xc3\\xb1ol\\n\\nContracts, transactions, and the records of them are among the defining structures in our economic, legal, and political systems. They protect assets and set organizational boundaries. They establish and verify identities and chronicle events. They govern interactions among nations, organizations, communities, and individuals. They guide managerial and social action. And yet these critical tools and the bureaucracies formed to manage them have not kept up with the economy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s digital transformation. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re like a rush-hour gridlock trapping a Formula 1 race car. In a digital world, the way we regulate and maintain administrative control has to change.\\nBlockchain promises to solve this problem. The technology at the heart of bitcoin and other virtual currencies, blockchain is an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way. The ledger itself can also be programmed to trigger transactions automatically. (See the sidebar \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow Blockchain Works.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d)\\n\\nHow Blockchain Works\\n\\nHere are five basic principles underlying the technology.\\n1. Distributed Database\\nEach party on a blockchain has access to the entire database and its complete history. No single party controls the data or the information. Every party can verify the records of its transaction partners directly, without an intermediary.\\n2. Peer-to-Peer Transmission\\nCommunication occurs directly between peers instead of through a central node. Each node stores and forwards information to all other nodes.\\n3. Transparency with Pseudonymity\\nEvery transaction and its associated value are visible to anyone with access to the system. Each node, or user, on a blockchain has a unique 30-plus-character alphanumeric address that identifies it. Users can choose to remain anonymous or provide proof of their identity to others. Transactions occur between blockchain addresses.\\n4. Irreversibility of Records\\nOnce a transaction is entered in the database and the accounts are updated, the records cannot be altered, because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re linked to every transaction record that came before them (hence the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cchain\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). Various computational algorithms and approaches are deployed to ensure that the recording on the database is permanent, chronologically ordered, and available to all others on the network.\\n5. Computational Logic\\nThe digital nature of the ledger means that blockchain transactions can be tied to computational logic and in essence programmed. So users can set up algorithms and rules that automatically trigger transactions between nodes.\\n\\n\\nWith blockchain, we can imagine a world in which contracts are embedded in digital code and stored in transparent, shared databases, where they are protected from deletion, tampering, and revision. In this world every agreement, every process, every task, and every payment would have a digital record and signature that could be identified, validated, stored, and shared. Intermediaries like lawyers, brokers, and bankers might no longer be necessary. Individuals, organizations, machines, and algorithms would freely transact and interact with one another with little friction. This is the immense potential of blockchain.\\nIndeed, virtually everyone has heard the claim that blockchain will revolutionize business and redefine companies and economies. Although we share the enthusiasm for its potential, we worry about the hype. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not just security issues (such as the 2014 collapse of one bitcoin exchange and the more recent hacks of others) that concern us. Our experience studying technological innovation tells us that if there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s to be a blockchain revolution, many barriers\\xe2\\x80\\x94technological, governance, organizational, and even societal\\xe2\\x80\\x94will have to fall. It would be a mistake to rush headlong into blockchain innovation without understanding how it is likely to take hold.\\nTrue blockchain-led transformation of business and government, we believe, is still many years away. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because blockchain is not a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdisruptive\\xe2\\x80\\x9d technology, which can attack a traditional business model with a lower-cost solution and overtake incumbent firms quickly. Blockchain is a foundational technology: It has the potential to create new foundations for our economic and social systems. But while the impact will be enormous, it will take decades for blockchain to seep into our economic and social infrastructure. The process of adoption will be gradual and steady, not sudden, as waves of technological and institutional change gain momentum. That insight and its strategic implications are what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll explore in this article.\\nPatterns of Technology Adoption\\nBefore jumping into blockchain strategy and investment, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reflect on what we know about technology adoption and, in particular, the transformation process typical of other foundational technologies. One of the most relevant examples is distributed computer networking technology, seen in the adoption of TCP/IP (transmission control protocol/internet protocol), which laid the groundwork for the development of the internet.\\nIntroduced in 1972, TCP/IP first gained traction in a single-use case: as the basis for e-mail among the researchers on ARPAnet, the U.S. Department of Defense precursor to the commercial internet. Before TCP/IP, telecommunications architecture was based on \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccircuit switching,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in which connections between two parties or machines had to be preestablished and sustained throughout an exchange. To ensure that any two nodes could communicate, telecom service providers and equipment manufacturers had invested billions in building dedicated lines.\\nTCP/IP turned that model on its head. The new protocol transmitted information by digitizing it and breaking it up into very small packets, each including address information. Once released into the network, the packets could take any route to the recipient. Smart sending and receiving nodes at the network\\xe2\\x80\\x99s edges could disassemble and reassemble the packets and interpret the encoded data. There was no need for dedicated private lines or massive infrastructure. TCP/IP created an open, shared public network without any central authority or party responsible for its maintenance and improvement.\\n\\nThis article also appears in:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBlockchain: The Insights You Need from Harvard Business Review\\n\\nTechnology and Operations\\nBook\\n\\n\\n\\n22.95\\n\\n\\nAdd to Cart\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Save\\n Share\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTraditional telecommunications and computing sectors looked on TCP/IP with skepticism. Few imagined that robust data, messaging, voice, and video connections could be established on the new architecture or that the associated system could be secure and scale up. But during the late 1980s and 1990s, a growing number of firms, such as Sun, NeXT, Hewlett-Packard, and Silicon Graphics, used TCP/IP, in part to create localized private networks within organizations. To do so, they developed building blocks and tools that broadened its use beyond e-mail, gradually replacing more-traditional local network technologies and standards. As organizations adopted these building blocks and tools, they saw dramatic gains in productivity.\\nTCP/IP burst into broad public use with the advent of the World Wide Web in the mid-1990s. New technology companies quickly emerged to provide the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cplumbing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94the hardware, software, and services needed to connect to the now-public network and exchange information. Netscape commercialized browsers, web servers, and other tools and components that aided the development and adoption of internet services and applications. Sun drove the development of Java, the application-programming language. As information on the web grew exponentially, Infoseek, Excite, AltaVista, and Yahoo were born to guide users around it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce this basic infrastructure gained critical mass, a new generation of companies took advantage of low-cost connectivity by creating internet services that were compelling substitutes for existing businesses. CNET moved news online. Amazon offered more books for sale than any bookshop. Priceline and Expedia made it easier to buy airline tickets and brought unprecedented transparency to the process. The ability of these newcomers to get extensive reach at relatively low cost put significant pressure on traditional businesses like newspapers and brick-and-mortar retailers.\\nRelying on broad internet connectivity, the next wave of companies created novel, transformative applications that fundamentally changed the way businesses created and captured value. These companies were built on a new peer-to-peer architecture and generated value by coordinating distributed networks of users. Think of how eBay changed online retail through auctions, Napster changed the music industry, Skype changed telecommunications, and Google, which exploited user-generated links to provide more relevant results, changed web search.\\n\\n\\nCompanies are already using blockchain to track items through complex supply chains.\\n\\n\\nUltimately, it took more than 30 years for TCP/IP to move through all the phases\\xe2\\x80\\x94single use, localized use, substitution, and transformation\\xe2\\x80\\x94and reshape the economy. Today more than half the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most valuable public companies have internet-driven, platform-based business models. The very foundations of our economy have changed. Physical scale and unique intellectual property no longer confer unbeatable advantages; increasingly, the economic leaders are enterprises that act as \\xe2\\x80\\x9ckeystones,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d proactively organizing, influencing, and coordinating widespread networks of communities, users, and organizations.\\nThe New Architecture\\nBlockchain\\xe2\\x80\\x94a peer-to-peer network that sits on top of the internet\\xe2\\x80\\x94was introduced in October 2008 as part of a proposal for bitcoin, a virtual currency system that eschewed a central authority for issuing currency, transferring ownership, and confirming transactions. Bitcoin is the first application of blockchain technology.\\nThe parallels between blockchain and TCP/IP are clear. Just as e-mail enabled bilateral messaging, bitcoin enables bilateral financial transactions. The development and maintenance of blockchain is open, distributed, and shared\\xe2\\x80\\x94just like TCP/IP\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. A team of volunteers around the world maintains the core software. And just like e-mail, bitcoin first caught on with an enthusiastic but relatively small community.\\nTCP/IP unlocked new economic value by dramatically lowering the cost of connections. Similarly, blockchain could dramatically reduce the cost of transactions. It has the potential to become the system of record for all transactions. If that happens, the economy will once again undergo a radical shift, as new, blockchain-based sources of influence and control emerge.\\nConsider how business works now. Keeping ongoing records of transactions is a core function of any business. Those records track past actions and performance and guide planning for the future. They provide a view not only of how the organization works internally but also of the organization\\xe2\\x80\\x99s outside relationships. Every organization keeps its own records, and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re private. Many organizations have no master ledger of all their activities; instead records are distributed across internal units and functions. The problem is, reconciling transactions across individual and private ledgers takes a lot of time and is prone to error.\\nFor example, a typical stock transaction can be executed within microseconds, often without human intervention. However, the settlement\\xe2\\x80\\x94the ownership transfer of the stock\\xe2\\x80\\x94can take as long as a week. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because the parties have no access to each other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ledgers and can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t automatically verify that the assets are in fact owned and can be transferred. Instead a series of intermediaries act as guarantors of assets as the record of the transaction traverses organizations and the ledgers are individually updated.\\nIn a blockchain system, the ledger is replicated in a large number of identical databases, each hosted and maintained by an interested party. When changes are entered in one copy, all the other copies are simultaneously updated. So as transactions occur, records of the value and assets exchanged are permanently entered in all ledgers. There is no need for third-party intermediaries to verify or transfer ownership. If a stock transaction took place on a blockchain-based system, it would be settled within seconds, securely and verifiably. (The infamous hacks that have hit bitcoin exchanges exposed weaknesses not in the blockchain itself but in separate systems linked to parties using the blockchain.)\\nA Framework for Blockchain Adoption\\nIf bitcoin is like early e-mail, is blockchain decades from reaching its full potential? In our view the answer is a qualified yes. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t predict exactly how many years the transformation will take, but we can guess which kinds of applications will gain traction first and how blockchain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s broad acceptance will eventually come about.\\n\\nHow Foundational Technologies Take Hold\\n\\nThe adoption of foundational technologies typically happens in four phases. Each phase is defined by the novelty of the applications and the complexity of the coordination efforts needed to make them workable. Applications low in novelty and complexity gain acceptance first. Applications high in novelty and complexity take decades to evolve but can transform the economy. TCP/IP technology, introduced on ARPAnet in 1972, has already reached the transformation phase, but blockchain applications (in red) are in their early days.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn our analysis, history suggests that two dimensions affect how a foundational technology and its business use cases evolve. The first is novelty\\xe2\\x80\\x94the degree to which an application is new to the world. The more novel it is, the more effort will be required to ensure that users understand what problems it solves. The second dimension is complexity, represented by the level of ecosystem coordination involved\\xe2\\x80\\x94the number and diversity of parties that need to work together to produce value with the technology. For example, a social network with just one member is of little use; a social network is worthwhile only when many of your own connections have signed on to it. Other users of the application must be brought on board to generate value for all participants. The same will be true for many blockchain applications. And, as the scale and impact of those applications increase, their adoption will require significant institutional change.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve developed a framework that maps innovations against these two contextual dimensions, dividing them into quadrants. (See the exhibit \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow Foundational Technologies Take Hold.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) Each quadrant represents a stage of technology development. Identifying which one a blockchain innovation falls into will help executives understand the types of challenges it presents, the level of collaboration and consensus it needs, and the legislative and regulatory efforts it will require. The map will also suggest what kind of processes and infrastructure must be established to facilitate the innovation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s adoption. Managers can use it to assess the state of blockchain development in any industry, as well as to evaluate strategic investments in their own blockchain capabilities.\\nSingle use.\\nIn the first quadrant are low-novelty and low-coordination applications that create better, less costly, highly focused solutions. E-mail, a cheap alternative to phone calls, faxes, and snail mail, was a single-use application for TCP/IP (even though its value rose with the number of users). Bitcoin, too, falls into this quadrant. Even in its early days, bitcoin offered immediate value to the few people who used it simply as an alternative payment method. (You can think of it as a complex e-mail that transfers not just information but also actual value.) At the end of 2016 the value of bitcoin transactions was expected to hit $92 billion. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still a rounding error compared with the $411 trillion in total global payments, but bitcoin is growing fast and increasingly important in contexts such as instant payments and foreign currency and asset trading, where the present financial system has limitations.\\nLocalization.\\nThe second quadrant comprises innovations that are relatively high in novelty but need only a limited number of users to create immediate value, so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still relatively easy to promote their adoption. If blockchain follows the path network technologies took in business, we can expect blockchain innovations to build on single-use applications to create local private networks on which multiple organizations are connected through a distributed ledger.\\n\\n\\n\\nMuch of the initial private blockchain-based development is taking place in the financial services sector, often within small networks of firms, so the coordination requirements are relatively modest. Nasdaq is working with Chain.com, one of many blockchain infrastructure providers, to offer technology for processing and validating financial transactions. Bank of America, JPMorgan, the New York Stock Exchange, Fidelity Investments, and Standard Chartered are testing blockchain technology as a replacement for paper-based and manual transaction processing in such areas as trade finance, foreign exchange, cross-border settlement, and securities settlement. The Bank of Canada is testing a digital currency called CAD-coin for interbank transfers. We anticipate a proliferation of private blockchains that serve specific purposes for various industries.\\nSubstitution.\\nThe third quadrant contains applications that are relatively low in novelty because they build on existing single-use and localized applications, but are high in coordination needs because they involve broader and increasingly public uses. These innovations aim to replace entire ways of doing business. They face high barriers to adoption, however; not only do they require more coordination but the processes they hope to replace may be full-blown and deeply embedded within organizations and institutions. Examples of substitutes include cryptocurrencies\\xe2\\x80\\x94new, fully formed currency systems that have grown out of the simple bitcoin payment technology. The critical difference is that a cryptocurrency requires every party that does monetary transactions to adopt it, challenging governments and institutions that have long handled and overseen such transactions. Consumers also have to change their behavior and understand how to implement the new functional capability of the cryptocurrency.\\nA recent experiment at MIT highlights the challenges ahead for digital currency systems. In 2014 the MIT Bitcoin Club provided each of MIT\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 4,494 undergraduates with $100 in bitcoin. Interestingly, 30% of the students did not even sign up for the free money, and 20% of the sign-ups converted the bitcoin to cash within a few weeks. Even the technically savvy had a tough time understanding how or where to use bitcoin.\\nOne of the most ambitious substitute blockchain applications is Stellar, a nonprofit that aims to bring affordable financial services, including banking, micropayments, and remittances, to people who\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never had access to them. Stellar offers its own virtual currency, lumens, and also allows users to retain on its system a range of assets, including other currencies, telephone minutes, and data credits. Stellar initially focused on Africa, particularly Nigeria, the largest economy there. It has seen significant adoption among its target population and proved its cost-effectiveness. But its future is by no means certain, because the ecosystem coordination challenges are high. Although grassroots adoption has demonstrated the viability of Stellar, to become a banking standard, it will need to influence government policy and persuade central banks and large organizations to use it. That could take years of concerted effort.\\n\\nFurther Reading\\n\\nTo learn more about technology adoption, go to these articles on HBR.org:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDigital Ubiquity: How Connections, Sensors, and Data Are Revolutionizing Business\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Marco Iansiti and Karim R. Lakhani\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrategy as Ecology\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Marco Iansiti and Roy Levien\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRight Tech, Wrong Time\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ron Adner and Rahul Kapoor\\n\\n\\nTransformation.\\nInto the last quadrant fall completely novel applications that, if successful, could change the very nature of economic, social, and political systems. They involve coordinating the activity of many actors and gaining institutional agreement on standards and processes. Their adoption will require major social, legal, and political change.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSmart contracts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d may be the most transformative blockchain application at the moment. These automate payments and the transfer of currency or other assets as negotiated conditions are met. For example, a smart contract might send a payment to a supplier as soon as a shipment is delivered. A firm could signal via blockchain that a particular good has been received\\xe2\\x80\\x94or the product could have GPS functionality, which would automatically log a location update that, in turn, triggered a payment. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve already seen a few early experiments with such self-executing contracts in the areas of venture funding, banking, and digital rights management.\\nThe implications are fascinating. Firms are built on contracts, from incorporation to buyer-supplier relationships to employee relations. If contracts are automated, then what will happen to traditional firm structures, processes, and intermediaries like lawyers and accountants? And what about managers? Their roles would all radically change. Before we get too excited here, though, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s remember that we are decades away from the widespread adoption of smart contracts. They cannot be effective, for instance, without institutional buy-in. A tremendous degree of coordination and clarity on how smart contracts are designed, verified, implemented, and enforced will be required. We believe the institutions responsible for those daunting tasks will take a long time to evolve. And the technology challenges\\xe2\\x80\\x94especially security\\xe2\\x80\\x94are daunting.\\nGuiding Your Approach to Blockchain Investment\\nHow should executives think about blockchain for their own organizations? Our framework can help companies identify the right opportunities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor most, the easiest place to start is single-use applications, which minimize risk because they aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t new and involve little coordination with third parties. One strategy is to add bitcoin as a payment mechanism. The infrastructure and market for bitcoin are already well developed, and adopting the virtual currency will force a variety of functions, including IT, finance, accounting, sales, and marketing, to build blockchain capabilities. Another low-risk approach is to use blockchain internally as a database for applications like managing physical and digital assets, recording internal transactions, and verifying identities. This may be an especially useful solution for companies struggling to reconcile multiple internal databases. Testing out single-use applications will help organizations develop the skills they need for more-advanced applications. And thanks to the emergence of cloud-based blockchain services from both start-ups and large platforms like Amazon and Microsoft, experimentation is getting easier all the time.\\n\\nThis article also appears in:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHBR\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 10 Must Reads on AI, Analytics, and the New Machine Age\\n\\nTechnology & Operations\\nBOOK\\n\\n\\n\\n24.95\\n\\n\\nAdd to Cart\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Save\\n Share\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLocalized applications are a natural next step for companies. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re seeing a lot of investment in private blockchain networks right now, and the projects involved seem poised for real short-term impact. Financial services companies, for example, are finding that the private blockchain networks they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve set up with a limited number of trusted counterparties can significantly reduce transaction costs.\\nOrganizations can also tackle specific problems in transactions across boundaries with localized applications. Companies are already using blockchain to track items through complex supply chains, for instance. This is happening in the diamond industry, where gems are being traced from mines to consumers. The technology for such experiments is now available off-the-shelf.\\nDeveloping substitute applications requires careful planning, since existing solutions may be difficult to dislodge. One way to go may be to focus on replacements that won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t require end users to change their behavior much but present alternatives to expensive or unattractive solutions. To get traction, substitutes must deliver functionality as good as a traditional solution\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and must be easy for the ecosystem to absorb and adopt. First Data\\xe2\\x80\\x99s foray into blockchain-based gift cards is a good example of a well-considered substitute. Retailers that offer them to consumers can dramatically lower costs per transaction and enhance security by using blockchain to track the flows of currency within accounts\\xe2\\x80\\x94without relying on external payment processors. These new gift cards even allow transfers of balances and transaction capability between merchants via the common ledger.\\n\\n\\nBlockchain could slash the cost of transactions and reshape the economy.\\n\\n\\nTransformative applications are still far away. But it makes sense to evaluate their possibilities now and invest in developing technology that can enable them. They will be most powerful when tied to a new business model in which the logic of value creation and capture departs from existing approaches. Such business models are hard to adopt but can unlock future growth for companies.\\nConsider how law firms will have to change to make smart contracts viable. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll need to develop new expertise in software and blockchain programming. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll probably also have to rethink their hourly payment model and entertain the idea of charging transaction or hosting fees for contracts, to name just two possible approaches. Whatever tack they take, executives must be sure they understand and have tested the business model implications before making any switch.\\nTransformative scenarios will take off last, but they will also deliver enormous value. Two areas where they could have a profound impact: large-scale public identity systems for such functions as passport control, and algorithm-driven decision making in the prevention of money laundering and in complex financial transactions that involve many parties. We expect these applications won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t reach broad adoption and critical mass for at least another decade and probably more.\\nTransformative applications will also give rise to new platform-level players that will coordinate and govern the new ecosystems. These will be the Googles and Facebooks of the next generation. It will require patience to realize such opportunities. Though it may be premature to start making significant investments in them now, developing the required foundations for them\\xe2\\x80\\x94tools and standards\\xe2\\x80\\x94is still worthwhile.\\nCONCLUSION\\nIn addition to providing a good template for blockchain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s adoption, TCP/IP has most likely smoothed the way for it. TCP/IP has become ubiquitous, and blockchain applications are being built on top of the digital data, communication, and computation infrastructure, which lowers the cost of experimentation and will allow new use cases to emerge rapidly.\\nWith our framework, executives can figure out where to start building their organizational capabilities for blockchain today. They need to ensure that their staffs learn about blockchain, to develop company-specific applications across the quadrants we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve identified, and to invest in blockchain infrastructure.\\nBut given the time horizons, barriers to adoption, and sheer complexity involved in getting to TCP/IP levels of acceptance, executives should think carefully about the risks involved in experimenting with blockchain. Clearly, starting small is a good way to develop the know-how to think bigger. But the level of investment should depend on the context of the company and the industry. Financial services companies are already well down the road to blockchain adoption. Manufacturing is not.\\nNo matter what the context, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a strong possibility that blockchain will affect your business.

    "#docs_new = ['In the heart of Silicon Valley, Stanford clinicians and researchers are exploring whether artificial intelligence could help manage a potential surge of Covid-19 patients — and identify patients who will need intensive care before their condition rapidly deteriorates. The challenge is not to build the algorithm — the Stanford team simply picked an off-the-shelf tool already on the market — but rather to determine how to carefully integrate it into already-frenzied clinical operations. “The hardest part, the most important part of this work is not the model development. But it’s the workflow design, the change management, figuring out how do you develop that system the model enables,” said Ron Li, a Stanford physician and clinical informaticist leading the effort. Li will present the work on Wednesday at a virtual conference hosted by Stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence. The effort is primed to be an accelerated test of whether hospitals can smoothly incorporate AI tools into their workflows. That process, typically slow and halting, is being sped up at hospitals all over the world in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.', \n",
    "#           'IoT refers to the ever-growing network of devices for internet connectivity and the communication that occurs between internet enabled devices and systems – think of your cellphone, tablet, or a smart car all talking to each other. IoT solutions use these devices to drive hyper-connectivity that can monitor, analyze, and push action on products, materials, and assets in ways that can improve organizations’ processes, as well as the everyday lives of the public.', \n",
    "#           'Today’s businesses are turning to enterprise blockchain for transparency and security. Organizations are searching for a simple blockchain definition to help them understand this emerging, “distributed ledger” technology. Here’s what savvy companies need to know about what it is, why it matters, and how it works. Blockchain explained: what is it? Blockchain is often referred to as a real-time, immutable record of transactions and ownership. But what does that mean? Basically, it is a reliable, difficult-to-hack record of transactions—and of who owns what. Think of a database with information stored in blocks. These blocks can be copied and replicated on individual computers. All of these are identical and synced with one another. When someone adds or subtracts data, it changes the information across them all.Each one is just as secure as your online banking portal—nearly unhackable. Blockchain ledgers can incorporate a wide swath of documents, including loans, land titles, logistics manifests, and almost anything of value. Big Data information can be shared in a multi-verification environment that is perfect for real-time, secure information sharing. Blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) folds the blockchain distributed ledger platform into the cloud-based software delivery and licensing model already popular with enterprises looking to cut costs while increasing security and efficiency. BaaS supplies the accountability, transparency, and security of blockchain already noted without using in-house resources, as service providers maintain the BaaS network in the cloud.'\n",
